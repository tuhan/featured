Not only its price has reached too far, but also its popularity globally amazes everyone. No one would thought in the first place that bitcoin will be this hyped and trending, but we all know the excellent potentials of bitcoin, so it's not surprising at all. There's still a lot of positive updates await for bitcoin, and we as bitcoiners, should always look forward for a brighter future waiting ahead of us.","2":"I would say Bitcoin has exceeded my expectations because in the beginning I knew Bitcoin is a very volatile and prices cannot be predicted accurately 100 percent so to now see my portfolio worth a lot more than when I bought my first bitcoins gives me so much joy.","3":"Quote from: Davidvictorson on November 05, 2024, 09:41:42 PM\nMy question to you is when you look back and see how far you have come in your Bitcoin journey and based on your reason for buying your first bitcoin , would you say that Bitcoin has met or exceeded your expectations?\nThis has clearly given something beyond my expectations at that time.

That's why we have never heard of any innovative ideas coming out of Japan in the field of cryptocurrency.","38":"Quote from: Synchronice on December 23, 2024, 08:19:47 PM\nRecently, Italy increased tax on crypto from 26% to 42%, Denmark also has up to 52% tax on crypto gains as far as I know. The world is going crazy, especially the government which thinks that we don't have a right to make profit, they want us to be enslaved to monthly salaries.\nthey know that crypto is allowing us to make profit which is why they are taking advantage and raising the taxes as much as they could this is really crazy what reason do they even present to justify this? this is why many hide the fact that they are into crypto due to taxes this high","39":"Quote from: apogio on December 23, 2024, 08:28:09 PM\nWhen governments set such huge tax percentages, they lead citizens to tax evasion.\n\nThey know it and they willingly try to earn as much as they can from the lawful citizens, whereas they allow the rest to enjoy huge profits.\nIt is a world wide trend it appears.  I do not know what it is that they are trying to do but it almost looks like they want to support and increase Money Laundering and Tax Evasion.  Because I would be simply stupid to even contemplate receiving -10 percent of my inheritance.  Pay the Government to receive nothing!  It is a Scam no matter how you look at it.\n\nIt is obvious families will try their best to hide the inheritance or find ways to avoid the Tax.  But this seems to happen with every thing around us.  When everybody thought of Bitcoiners as Criminals, some fellow programmers put together foundations of ways to improve and have Privacy with Bitcoin.  This only led to more people hiding if anything.\n\nWhen they started to introduce back doors into communication software, they created an opportunity for the most private communication software to be created and released to the public.\n\nWhen they became so keen on supervising all and every Bank Account transfer and Card payment as if each and every one of us were born Criminals, they launched an opportunity for more people to Withdraw Cash and use it Anonymously.  This made more people hide from their system.\n\nI agree the number of people opposing the new rules and supervision is way too low however.  They probably do not care much about the few of us who care.  Numbers speak and they are likely more happy to have control over more people while a few others escape out of the radar than have little control over almost everybody.\n\nGovernments are almost never there for us.  They only lie well enough for most people to think that way.","40":"Quote from: Synchronice on December 23, 2024, 08:19:47 PM\nI couldn't believe what I read but it's true. In Japan, if you sell a crypto, you have to pay 55% any gain you make from it but that's not the end of nightmare, that's the start and a true nightmare starts when you receive a crypto inheritance. An inheritance tax is maxed out at 55%, so, if we combine inheritance tax, income tax and local resident tax, the person who got crypto as an inheritance will pay up to 110% taxes, which means that you pay 10% more than what you got.\nthat's fucked up, they are basically pushing their citizens to avoid crypto.

The \"get rich quick\" sentiment is nothing new by the way; the novelty is the major institutional involvement.\n\nBitcoin has a quite complex system of checks and balances. If a single big player like Saylor tried to change something fundamentally, e.g. proposing a protocol upgrade and executing pressure on Bitcoin Core developers, then it is still likely that many other actors would reject that upgrade if it is directed against decentralization. An actor wanting to change something has not only to convince the Bitcoin Core devs, but also miners and minor holders.

Nowadays central banks are under governments' full control and do whatever the governments tell them. Even the CBDCs are introduced and are likely to be enforced by the governments and not the central banks.

Regarding BTC and other crypto money, the governments want to keep them as fully-transparent commodities that will be traded on exchanges for those who want to invest or play on the market.

All of these terrible arguments he's presented throughout the years have actually created him a whole business. Peter Schiff has built an entire name around the Bitcoin space. He's made fortune from all the goldbugs he's attracted since 2010.\n\nA lot of bitcoiners see him as a fool, but he's actually one big, smart actor doing his smart business.\n\nHe is not the only one doing this and maybe in real life he might not even be a Bitcoin hater all that much as he tend to use it to build a name and a business for himself of which he has done well and like you said enjoying the benefits of his business.

Schiff is an idiot and if you listened to him you are a fool.\n\nIn 2011 gold was trading at $1900. Today the price of gold is around $2600 so it barely moved in 14 years, while bitcoin has gone up nearly 6,000%.\nCompared to bitcoin, or even the S&P 500 gold is a joke. Only idiots invest in gold.

If you're following an idiot like him, now's the time to switch sides.\n\nJust imagine this, you bought $1000 worth of Gold and Bitcoin in 2022 when the market is down. Which of the 2 will give you more profit? It's Bitcoin, but since you're following what Schiff is saying, you missed the opportunity to earn more. He's been criticizing Bitcoin for years and still criticizing it on his X account until now. Nothing new, but I hope he realizes that nobody's following him and what he's saying.\n\nSpeaking of criticism, here's another person that's criticizing Bitcoin as well. He's saying that he knows how the creator is and when he comes out, he says that BITCOIN WILL GO TO ZERO.

There are rumours of the US thinking about having a Bitcoin reserve, It might only be speculation and nothing real about it but it would be a big steps for this rumour to be true. Bitcoin was created to be scarce hence there wouldn't be enough when it gets adopted by the government of countries. Only few big companies adopting Bitcoin is already making the price to be too expensive for many people to buy and when big countries like the US starts to adopt it, there might not be any left for us to buy or it would be too costly by that time. Bitcoin is better than gold, it has a better supply, it has a better price hence over the years, Bitcoin is going to have a better price than gold would.","124":"While Bitcoin has an intrinsically inelastic supply, gold is continually mined, with its supply increased every year. Such scarcity is one of many reasons why Bitcoin has been believed to be a hedge against inflation. More classically, though, everybody trusts gold as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty that date back centuries. Growing institutional and retail confidence in Bitcoin after the election shows Bitcoin ETF inflows jumping to a record in the post election week to $2.6 billion.\n\nThat said, the volatility in Bitcoin is a serious drawback to the stability in value that gold offers. Large reserves of gold are held by governments and central banks, while the movement of Bitcoin as a reserve asset is only just beginning. Of course, in the event that countries turn to Bitcoin for reserves, the higher price this could drive may benefit the holders but also make it very difficult for everyday transactions. But the possibility of Bitcoin ever wholly replacing gold is slim, more likely, it may complement gold as a strategic reserve asset, and experts stress its increasing yet not leading position.","125":"No content","126":"Warren Buffett is selling off stocks this year and hoarding USD.

But that was not just US in recession, but most of the world was also in recession which meant the sell pressure was global and it caused the drops which is why bitcoin is still below $100k after all this time.\n\nIn the future, more recession which they only would battle by increasing interest rates in the US, would similarly cause sell pressure and can affect the bull run.\n\nThe only two other things to consider are:\n1) Will it be global? In your arguments, the recession is in US only and as long as it remains that way the impact on bitcoin is not going to be as big as it was before.\n2) Will there be inflation as well? All the deportation (firing bulk of US workforce) and the tariff war would create much higher inflation compared to the past couple of years in the US. We already know inflation positively affects bitcoin by increasing its price.\n\nOn top of that we have dedollarisation going on and with Trump and his wars against their world (specially now that we have seen some of his cabinet members who are the biggest warmongers in America) we can be sure that dedollarisation will speed up which can lead to US dollar tanking hard.\nObviously that means bitcoin price shooting up automatically.","145":"Quote from: asriloni on November 16, 2024, 05:27:38 AM\nWarren's just following his old philosophy when many are still euphoric after Trump's winner in US election, then he took advantage to sell his asset at peak.\n\nHonestly, now is the wrong time to buy Bitcoin.

In my opinion the current US election climate is more nuanced and not quite an endorsement for stability. The market reactions this far tend to be indicative that the policy posture of Trump, with a possibility for laying trade tariffs and immigration reform, might further sustain inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. For this, investors may take notice and change positions both in traditional assets and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In light of the key position taken by Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, these actions could actually increase its demand. Contrary to the assumption that a Trump win would hold no weight of great importance to Bitcoin.\n\nHistorically, elections add a layer of volatility and may influence a shift in sentiment. That had been the case in the previous years, when both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin tended to be up after elections. A win by Trump could be a replay of the post-election rally of 2016, propelled by business-friendly policies. However, extended turmoil or uncertainty over his policies would keep Bitcoin more volatile. While Bitcoin has remained accessible, therefore, any economic policy change in the United States, whoever the president might be, is still likely to continue its influence on investor psychology within the given sector.","162":"Quote from: legiteum on November 07, 2024, 03:31:43 PM\n2.

Construct a multi-signature wallet, that consists of 2 cosigners (2-of-2).\n2. Back up the 2 cosigners twice each. So you will have A1, A2, B1, B2, where A1 = A2 and B1 = B2.\n3. Store all the backups in 4 separate locations.\n4. Hold A1 yourself and give B1 to your inheritors. A2 and B2 will be stored in very safe places that you will determine. A1 and A2 will be known to you only. B2 will be known to the inheritors. So they will know where B1 and B2 backups are.\n5. In your will, you will give them the locations of A1, A2 and specific instructions on how to recover the wallet using one of the A1, A2 and one of the B1, B2. Obviously you can let them know about your plan and teach them what they will need to do beforehand. So in your will you need to specify the locations only. But a recovery plan written in the will is not redundant in my opinion.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Only you have access to the wallet during your lifetime, because the locations A1, A2 are not known.\n2. The inheritors have B1 and B2, which means that they will need to \"lose\" both of them to lose access to the wallet.\n3. The lawyers know where A1, A2 are stored, but even if they gained access to them, they can't do anything because they are ignorant about B1, B2.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Kind of hard for the inheritors? Perhaps...\n2. If the lawyer loses your will, then both locations A1 and A2 become unknown, so the wallet is non recoverable. To mitigate this, you can use 2 lawyers, one holding A1's location and one holding A2's location.\n\nPlan B:\n1. Generate a wallet (simple single-sig) and give it to your children. Also keep a backup somewhere safe (the children can know about it).\n2. Create a locktime transaction, setting the locktime to be X years from now. The receiving address will be one address from the wallet in step (1).\n3. Give the locktime transaction to your heirs, but also keep some backups in some places.\n4. When the time passes, the children can receive the funds.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Very easy. One broadcast and everything is good.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. The fee needs to be planned ahead. Of course the children can use CPFP later, but this adds a little complexity.\n2. The years are limiting. You can update the locktime transaction of course, but you will need to update your whole setup again. May cause confusion to the inheritors.\n\nPlease, share your ideas below and add your plans so we can have a discussion about them.\n\n\nMore\/New ideas:\nAny good plan that is shared in this discussion, I will add it to this post.","169":"I simple shared my seed with a trusted family member.

The idea of building a multi-signature wallet is really good for ensuring security, but it would also be important to train the heirs so that they know how to manage these assets. In addition, having clear documentation on the steps to follow and the locations of the backups could really help avoid confusion. For example, we can establish a document that explains how to access the backups and how to use the keys to recover the wallet, while showing them how to do it step by step. This would ensure that, even if something happens, the heirs can easily access all of this.

This happens a lot with new investors. They are either too scared or too eager. They buy when they see the market going up because of FOMO and even though I know bitcoin will still continue to rise, it is important that you buy it at the cheapest price possible not the most expensive to obtain maximum profit.

Thats the first fun fact making it an even better asset and form of money.\n\nNow, to be considered as money, it should be able to facilitate transactions, and have a standard unit of value.. Bitcoin meets these criteria, serving as a medium of exchange, with its own pricing mechanism and ability to store and retrieve value, despite volatility...as a digital asset, Bitcoin represents unique digital ownership, offering potential value appreciation over time. Again, its total supply is capped at 21 million, giving it the last attribute, scarcity\n\n\nI'm not the type that likes writing a wall of text but I just tried to see how I can use my common knowledge to explain why BTC is both a digital asset, a better form of money, and why it was created as an alternative payments method.

In terminology, cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptography for security.[1]  You can read more about cryptocurrency below[1]  and Bitcoin is part of these so called cryptocurrency meaning Bitcoin is under the umbrella of cryptocurrency.  Even if you believe that crypto is not Bitcoin (which is wrong) but altcoin, they still have in common.  They both runs in blockchain, the difference is that some are running in centralized blockchain and others are in decentralized blockchain.

They both have advantages and disadvantage so I think whether Bitcoin is a superior form of money is debatable.  Certain issues like scaling, time confirmation, volatility, and use case is attached to Bitcoin so I think we cannot fully say that Bitcoin is far superior form of money. And decentralization might be the strongest feature of Bitcoin but it also serves as the greatest flaw of Bitcoin to those who are not fond of it, especially the centralized authority and this impedes the adoption of Bitcoin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/cryptocurrency.asp","259":"We don't have to start arguing over Bitcoin as an asset or not because history have already prove Bitcoin to be a store of value and an asset that appreciates in value with respect to time.

Can the nature increase the size of the earth? No, that isn't a possibility. Other assets such as metals and precious minerals, can have an unknown supply, of course, no human being can determine how much oil or gold exists in the whole world and whether or not more of its supply can come into circulation in the future because more can be found. Oil is a different thing as well because it's consumed and it vanishes after that.\n\nTalking about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, if we say that Bitcoin is an asset because it has value and can be used to carry out transactions then I would say it's arguable that all cryptocurrencies that exist in the market right now are assets because they all can be used to carry out transactions and they all have a value, for the time being.\n\nQuote from: Iranus on September 05, 2024, 09:52:05 AM\nIt can be said that it depends on each person's needs and each person will use it in different circumstances.

So, i don't feel bothered by it.

I like Bitcoin with all my heart, no digital currency comes close when it comes to everything about it but you see this congestion, it sucks when there too many transactions on the network and you are left with no choice than to wait because the asking fee is even bigger than what you want to send to another wallet.\n\nIf you want to bye pass this problems in future, make sure you consolidate your inputs into a single place, it helps you spend low fees when it comes to times like this, consolidation of inputs helps you get small inputs and this help you mini reduces the amount you will spend for every input in your transaction because segwit address fees are actually low but this doesn't mean you wouldn't pay more if there is high congestion, you sometimes need to pay optimum to be able to get your transaction through.","284":"No content","285":"Quote\nBREAKING: The #Bitcoin Conference is unable to lock down Vice President Kamal Harris - Attacks her positions on BTC - claims it would been \u201ca disaster\u201d for her.\nDennis Porter\n\nTrump seems to be the one most Bitcoiners support.","286":"I am honestly bored of the Trump and Bitcoin talk, but I can also admit that the Biden administration with Kamala Harris as vice has been anti-bitcoin for the most part of it.

If he does not make a good code, such platform can be hacked and coins will be lost and lose value because of price dump.\n\n\nEthereum offers more fast and cheap transactions\n\nWhen compared between Bitcoin and Ethereum, in general Ethereum\u2019s transactions are faster and cheaper. It is a very important point when evaluating a coin.\nBut Ethereum\u2019s network has much baggage like NFT\u2019s and it can happen for Ethereum to be more expensive at times, compared to Bitcoin.\nSo, Ethereum transactions are not necessarily cheaper.\n\n\nBitcoin has SegWit to lower transaction fees\n\nSegWit offers us compared to Legacy or nested SegWit really low transaction fees and it will reduce our costs paid for transaction fees a lot.\nSegWit transactions are simply smaller in size compared to legacy transactions because all witness data (signatures) is separated from transaction data. As a result, we get a lower fee per transaction vbyte.\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s SegWit offers increased Block Capacity\n\nBitcoin has a limit of transactions in terms of transaction size for each Block: a limited number of transactions can only be fitted into each Bitcoin block, limiting Bitcoin\u2019s capacity in terms of  transaction size per new block. \nSegWit allows more transactions to be fitted into each block. By separating all witness data, SegWit effectively decreases size limits for each transaction and effectively increases Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit, which helps to process more transactions per block. \nSo, SegWit actively helps to reduce congestion in Bitcoin\u2019s mempool.\n\nOverall, using SegWit addresses will help us to reduce transaction costs, have a better network performance and future-proofing for additional improvements and features for Bitcoin.\n\n\nReasons for and against Pos vs. PoW\n\nQuite contrary to PoS, PoW is very hard or almost impossible to compromise. Not so for PoS, where more attack vectors can be found.\n\nFor example, PoS can be abused by rich stakers. Many PoS projects have a so-called pre-mining of coins allocated to the team and the team can abuse such pre-mined coins to gain influence about project decisions.\nA large pre-mine is making a project centralized in many ways and devs can gain much influence by staking a large amount of PoS coins.\nPoW is not having such issues.\n\nA similar problem is called \"nothing at stake\", where attackers benefit from no cost to stake ETH or similar PoS coins. Should a fork occur, no matter if the fork is a friendly, accidental or a malicious attempt to rewrite history and reverse transactions, it\u2019s a given strategy for any staker to stake on every chain. By doing so, he will get a reward no matter which fork will succeed and he will have no additional cost to do so.\nIn PoW, such a problem is not happening because PoW always means work (spending electricity) needs to be done. A cost occurs for every miner and he can\u2019t mine on multiple chains because mining of a different chain means an extra cost.\n\n\nBitcoin is well reviewed\n\nWhen Bitcoin was invented, it was set up to be a big security. Hacks should be impossible and get prevented by good code. Bitcoin attracted and still has a very large community of really educated developers.\nBitcoin has a very reliable coder community, where flaws will be detected early before implementation and no risks are being taken. Many much smaller coins have a very flawed code review process.\nA large and educated coder community reviewing code during testing times is an important advantage for Bitcoin.\n\nAnd luckily, it saves us from possible hacks, when hackers are prevented from detecting flaws faster because all flaws are removed before implementation.\nWe have seen so many hacks, where a flawed code was exploited and people lost money, like for Altcoin cross chain bridges recently or when Terra Luna failed.\nStill, people are buying coins from unreliable coders like Tron from Justin Sun or even weaker DeFi coins like Acala Stablecoin from Polkadot\u2019s supplier Web 3.\nUnfortunately, some people will only learn after a loss.\n\nSome coins are very centralized and have a single point of failure like Solana, when it was down several times or devs have much power like in Binance Coin or Tron.\nAnd DeFi coins can easily print some more coins \/ tokens into existence.\nBitcoin is having a big advantage here.\n\n\n\nBitcoin has PoW\n\nIt is big controversy for a long time, if a coin makes PoW or PoS, like it was for Ethereum [ETH]. Not for Bitcoin because Bitcoin developers have decided PoW is best because of security. From what Experts have said so far, PoW is very hard or almost impossible to compromise instead of PoS, where more attack vectors can be found. Like Corona, we should trust majority of experts who have education and experience in an issue. Satoshi implemented PoW not PoS because Satoshi knew. He was very experienced and called it right.\nPoS can be abused by rich stakers and makes a project centralized in many ways like premined coins and devs can create much influence by staking a large amount of PoS coins. PoW is not having such issues.\n\n\nSecurity is Bitcoin\u2019s priority\n\nAs for a safe cryptocurrency, security standards are very important. First point, we need security standards and Satoshi implemented it right himself, when he developed Bitcoin. Early Bitcoin developers added more security standards. Second point is after some time, to NOT remove such security standards. First point and especially second point are relevant to many Altcoins, which is a big issue for Altcoins.\nMany Altcoins don\u2019t offer anymore to create private and public keys to prove ownership of funds and access it. It is very concerning and seems mind blowing to many experienced coders.\nFor example, when creating a Solana wallet or similar new Altcoins. Altcoin developers are not focusing on security.\nOr even MEW is bitching around more and more every time going away by implementing insecure patches. We need to have our private key offline.\nMany Altcoins are leaving people vulnerable which is very concerning.\nBitcoin is better like Electrum for example. Its design is not so nice but Electrum is good tech and recommended by many experts.\n\nBitcoin is still having very high security standards today because of Bitcoin does not want to build a hype coin, Bitcoin wants to build a safe coin.\nIt is our duty to select a safe coin instead of an unsafe hype coin.","349":"Quote from: Phu Juck on July 23, 2024, 03:02:14 PM\nLet\u2019s make a list here about Bitcoin vs. Ethereum topic.\nIt is unnecessary to compare Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nChronologically, with what already happened, if Bitcoin was not created, Ethereum was not created too. Vitalik Buterin was enlightened by Bitcoin so that he believed in decentralization and built Ethereum. Years later, he moved from decentralization with Proof of Work to centralization with Proof of Stake. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer with Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum even with Proof of Work, was still centralized with majority of ETH in hands of Vitalik.\n\nQuote\nSecurity is Bitcoin\u2019s priority\nBitcoin network is stronger and more secure than altcoin blockchains.\nhttps:\/\/howmanyconfs.com\/\n\nIf you want to see Ethereum, use Wayback machine.\nhttps:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200522061503\/https:\/\/howmanyconfs.com\/\n\nWith that wayback machine time point, you have information for comparison: 6 confirmations of Bitcoin blockchain equal to 1h 7min but with Ethereum blockchain, to gain similar security, you will need 887 confirmations that equivalent to 3h 16mins.\n\nDo you see big difference?","350":"ETH is something completely different from bitcoin. It's a platform on which other projects are built and it's more of a work in progress kind of project that changes as it goes. A great example of these changes is going from PoW to PoS.\n\nBitcoin is more of a store of value type of asset, a digital gold, the first cryptocurrency, a commodity.\n\nETH has a lot of weak links for instance its founders being alive and open for attacks from government agencies. A live leader can be sued, blackmailed, arrested, even assassinated if needed. He's only human who if forced to dump his stash will do it. People go insane all the time. There's no assurance that Vitalik won't end up in a mental facility in a few years.\nIf I were to choose one of these I'd always choose bitcoin.","351":"Although some consider this a big topic but in the end this remains the same as the previous discussion where there is nothing to argue about because after all bitcoin is much bigger and better so we cannot assume that this will be a competition because even Ethereum itself eventually follows bitcoin both in terms of price and their journey.\n\nThere is no avoiding that ETH is still very good for altcoins right now but that doesn't mean bitcoin and ETH can be compared because in the end the conditions remain the same where bitcoin remains the first in terms of choice and after that only ETH and other altcoins.\nI think for this discussion in the end it will continue like that where we will remain and choose bitcoin if faced with 2 choices even though ETH is not a bad thing but in the end bitcoin remains the best.","352":"Quote from: Phu Juck on July 23, 2024, 03:02:14 PM\nWhen we exchange your valuable Bitcoin or Ethereum for a different alt coin,\nEthereum itself is an altcoin itself and using bitcoin and ethereum in the same context doesn't make much sense!

We saw that during the 2017 ether pump due to the ICO craze where it became nearly impossible to use due to high fees.\nEthereum also has slower transactions because as it was pointed out 1 confirmation on the mutable ethereum blockchain is not the same as 1 confirmation on immutable bitcoin blockchain.\n\nQuote\nWhen compared between Bitcoin and Ethereum, in general Ethereum\u2019s transactions are faster and cheaper. It is a very important point when evaluating a coin.\nIt is more important to first understand what \"fast\" means.\nFast transaction doesn't mean when they get included in a block, it means when they become irreversible.\nOne confirmation on Bitcoin blockchain is usually equal to dozens up to in certain cases thousands of confirmation on other chains, and that's assuming they too have immutable blockchains. For an altcoin with a mutable blockchain where they have a history of rolling back blocks, no number of confirmation can be considered truly safe anymore.\n\nQuote\nit can happen for Ethereum to be more expensive at times, compared to Bitcoin.\nNo, that's impossible simply because Ethereum is useless (it's only used for hyped up short lived ICO garbage and its family) and also most importantly ether has an unlimited supply so like fiat it will continue losing value in long run not gain value.\n\nQuote\nSegWit transactions are simply smaller in size compared to legacy transactions because all witness data (signatures) is separated from transaction data.\nSegWit transactions have a smaller weight not size.\nThe witness data is also NOT separated from the transaction data. It is still part and parcel of the transaction.\n\nQuote\na limited number of transactions can only be fitted into each Bitcoin block,\nAll blockchain based cryptocurrencies have a block size cap so they can only include a finite number of transactions in each block.\n\nQuote\nBy separating all witness data, SegWit effectively decreases size limits for each transaction and effectively increases Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit,\nAs I said witness is not separated. The block and transaction structure is changed so that transactions can contain more data and blocks to contain more transactions in a backward compatible way.\n\nQuote\nA large pre-mine is making a project centralized\nAnd ethereum has a massive premine ...\n\nQuote\nStill, people are buying coins from unreliable coders like Tron from Justin Sun or even weaker DeFi coins like Acala Stablecoin from Polkadot\u2019s supplier Web 3.\nUnfortunately, some people will only learn after a loss.\nWell, such people aren't actually buying \"coins\", they are making bets on random stuff trying to make some money gambling.

You can also make payments with it anywhere in the world that a merchant accepts it.\n\nNon-Institutional.\n\nBitcoin is not tied to any government, corporation, religion, or institution. If you live in a country with a failing government or failing currency you can still do business and not worry about losing all your hard earned money.\n\nLower Fees.\n\nAs mentioned before the fees are much cheaper than Western Unions.\n\nSecurity.\n\nThe Bitcoin network has never been hacked. Provided you properly store your private keys your Bitcoin is safe.\n\nNon-banked.\n\nBitcoin does not require a bank to use. This means that you can take online payments from people who do not have bank accounts. You also won\u2019t have all those pesky bank fees. You also don\u2019t have to worry about your Bitcoin being frozen arbitrarily by a bank.\n\nNew Customers.\n\nMake an announcement that you are accepting Bitcoin and it will draw attention from the cryptocurrency crowd.

It is \"impossible\" for any government or other large entity to control Bitcoin.\n\n2. Bitcoin is \"absolutely safe\" since the redundancy and dispersal of the network makes it impossible to compromise.\n\nBut as we discussed in another thread here, Satoshi identified, in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, the risk of a \"51% attack\" on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin's integrity is safe, Satoshi said in essence, as long as a majority of the network's hashrate is not \"evil\".\n\nBitcoin's hashrate is controlled by \"miners\", and some of these mining companies are large, publicly traded companies.\n\nThe question this brings up is this: how hard would it be for some \"evil\" entity--say a major world government or an extremely sophisticated group of hackers--to gain control of the the companies (or key personnel within those companies, or key servers within those companies) that comprise over 51% of the hashrate, and thus take control of Bitcoin? Or in another scenario, how many companies would a large government e.g. the US or the EU need to compel in order to effectively change the Bitcoin network?\n\nHere is an article that alleges that just 0.1% of Bitcoin miners control half of all mining capacity. It's a little old, and I would wonder if the hashrate is even more concentrated now, since that's what businesses tend to do: consolidate.\n\nDoes anybody have any more recent data about this? To me, this seems like a really big deal since it calls the security of the Bitcoin network itself into question. And at minimum, the idea that only a handful of public, not-government-proof, companies actually control Bitcoin sorta... flies in the face of the prevailing Bitcoin mythology .","442":"The 51% rule on the bitcoin network is like a protocol that suggests that if a miner or mining pool is able to attain 51% of the total Bitcoin network's hash rate they will have an edge over the whole network and can dominate blocks more significantly by being able to do certain things like alter more recent blocks and some other stuff.\n\nThe fact is that the chances of some miner or mining pool pulling a 51% attack is very thin. This is because aside from the fact that attaining such amount of hash power would not be easy, I believe no pool will be soo foolish to waste such huge amount of hash rate to harm a network that they can benefit heavily from with that same hash rate. Every miner is out for profit and pulling such an attack that might even be neutralized would be uneconomical.","443":"Quote from: legiteum on June 06, 2024, 07:48:16 PM\n\nThe question this brings up is this: how hard would it be for some \"evil\" entity--say a major world government or an extremely sophisticated group of hackers--to gain control of the the companies (or key personnel within those companies, or key servers within those companies) that comprise over 51% of the hashrate, and thus take control of Bitcoin? Or in another scenario, how many companies would a large government e.g. the US or the EU need to compel in order to effectively change the Bitcoin network?\n\n\nWith the current hashrate percentage, as you asked the government will only get to hold onto just two pools; foundary USA (26.67% hashrate) and Antpool (25.38% hashrate) to make it a 51% hashrate. There is more because the government will need to actually generate large electricity again to be able to continue mining without the other miners getting a block.\n\nAlso one thing we have failed to understand about 51% attack or double spending is that the Miner with this hash power wouldn\u2019t still be able to use it get in invalid transactions in, other nodes will need to accept the transactions first. Having an invalid transaction like you think will just nullify the work done by the mining pool and also means they lost energy.\n\nBut overall this will be very bad for the network as they could even censor some transactions that they will include in their blocks and you will have to wait till the smaller miners get to mine a block and add your transaction","444":"Performing a 51% attack on the network will be a very tough task considering the things that must be involved. A 51% attack will require the performer to have control over at least 51% of the total computing power (hash rate). This attack would cost so much since the computing power will require more powerful hardware and consume more energy. But we should also understand that the more the network grows with more people on board, the more secure Bitcoin becomes, making 51% attack more difficult to perform. which means, as more adoptors, Bitcoin price, mining difficulty,etc continue to increase, then the network security also increase.

It is \"impossible\" for any government or other large entity to control Bitcoin.\n\n2. Bitcoin is \"absolutely safe\" since the redundancy and dispersal of the network makes it impossible to compromise.\n\nBut as we discussed in another thread here, Satoshi identified, in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, the risk of a \"51% attack\" on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin's integrity is safe, Satoshi said in essence, as long as a majority of the network's hashrate is not \"evil\".\n\nBitcoin's hashrate is controlled by \"miners\", and some of these mining companies are large, publicly traded companies.\n\nThe question this brings up is this: how hard would it be for some \"evil\" entity--say a major world government or an extremely sophisticated group of hackers--to gain control of the the companies (or key personnel within those companies, or key servers within those companies) that comprise over 51% of the hashrate, and thus take control of Bitcoin? Or in another scenario, how many companies would a large government e.g. the US or the EU need to compel in order to effectively change the Bitcoin network?\n\nHere is an article that alleges that just 0.1% of Bitcoin miners control half of all mining capacity. It's a little old, and I would wonder if the hashrate is even more concentrated now, since that's what businesses tend to do: consolidate.\n\nDoes anybody have any more recent data about this? To me, this seems like a really big deal since it calls the security of the Bitcoin network itself into question. And at minimum, the idea that only a handful of public, not-government-proof, companies actually control Bitcoin sorta... flies in the face of the prevailing Bitcoin mythology .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou've talked about the control of governments of Bitcoin but you haven't talked about the big investors that control and manipulate that market of Bitcoin. You can't just hide one thing by  enforcing over another thing.Yoh should have a debate on control of big investors on BTC prices.\n\nIve seen people applying the best techniques and skills that could be possibly applied for the prediction of trade but often then they have seen suprisingly behaviour of BTc that wasn't expected by anyone so why's that?","451":"Bitcoin is decentralized and has a certain level of privacy that makes it hard to answer this very question because in order to know the degree of centralization of mining we have to be able to measure how much of the hashrate we see in total or on mining pools belongs to the pool itself and how much of it belongs to independent miners who would go away if the pool turned malicious.\n\nThis is why you are already getting false information here about Foundry USA and Antpool that leads you to the false conclusion \"two public companies in the world that control over half of the Bitcoin network\". These companies do NOT control the entire said percentage of hashrate. They are mining pools that actual miners with actual hashrate connect to. The hashrate in their own control is less.\nThat means if the pool turns malicious, miners would migrate and that percentage would fall.\n\nAlso keep in mind that in order for an entity to perform a 51% attack they will have to have actual control over the mining equipment. Meaning the said government has to kick down doors and send SWAT teams to physically seize people's ASICs from their homes (the solo home miners) or from the companies (farms) to be able to first control that much ASIC then provide the infrastructure to install and start mining (ie. massive location, electricity, cooling, staff, etc).\nThat's because no miner in their right mind would ever participate in an attack against something they are making a profit from because the moment that attack takes place, their revenue would head toward zero. So they either migrate their business elsewhere (offshoring) or just shut down and enjoy whatever bitcoin they already have.\n\nQuote\nHere is an article that alleges that just 0.1% of Bitcoin miners control half of all mining capacity.\nI'm not familiar with NBER works but I skimmed through the 55 page they published and I have to say that's an interesting effort but I still don't like their methodology and the logic they used like the following:\n\"The idea is that miners in a particular region would most likely send their rewards to an exchange that is\nalso in this region.\"\nThis is a weak logic at best that makes their conclusion unreliable as well.\nhttps:\/\/www.nber.org\/system\/files\/working_papers\/w29396\/w29396.pdf\n\nIn any case we should be concerned about centralization creeping in at all times. But I wouldn't make any conclusions on whether things are already centralized or not.\n\nOne of the biggest hits on decentralization of mining was when China shut down mining in its territory, forcing them to migrate elsewhere increasing the hashrate concentration elsewhere. We needed this kind of diversification so that if one independent \"bloc\" went crazy the rest remain sane.","452":"They can't do that anyway, that's because there's a regulations about this and when they reach that, they will have no choice to split up again right so the 51% isn't a possibility.

Use the services of a well-known exchangers aggregator, because they had the direction of exchanging bitcoin for cash (and vice versa).\n\nQuote from: kotajikikox on May 25, 2024, 12:31:14 PM\nFirstly, you are going to need to use a centralized exchange here. Centralized exchange have KYC so they are able to verify your identity and other information. If you are using a centralized exchange and one that has good reputation then the chances of your bank raising questions might reduce.\nWhen I see advice on using centralized exchangers and KYCs on a forum where they talk about financial freedom and independence, I feel uneasy.\n\nQuote from: kotajikikox on May 25, 2024, 12:31:14 PM\nThere\u2019s really no sure way of preventing banks from asking questions without having to show them that you are indeed just transferring some of your money and no illegal activity is happening. However just make sure that when they do raise questions you are equipped with the required documents and hoping you are not evading any taxes because that will surely put you in trouble.\nIf you want to use their services, you will have to play by their rules: banks take your money, and you report to them for every penny and shake so that your account is not frozen.","471":"You shouldn't be asking how to not get questioned by the bank but what answers to give if you get such questions. If Bitcoin is legal in your country, then proceeds from Bitcoin investment sales is a good reason for the sum you would be receiving into your account. You can also exchange in installments, so you don't get one huge sum at the same time;\nFor example, in some regions, amounts above $10,000 will be queried, but not $9,900 done twice.\n\nRemember to document the txid from when you bought Bitcoin and when you sold.\n\nAbout tax authorities you may need to speak to an advisor who will guide you on how to fill your tax report. Tax laws vary from country to country and even within states in the same country so you'll need to have accurate information on your tax obligations and possible loopholes that allow you spend less.","472":"If you want to do that, my advice is to process wd to fiat with an amount that is not too noticeable and if at the same time it is not impossible that the bank will ask about all of it with a note to you. Unless you are an entrepreneur who has run a large business and has booked a special customer card from the bank with a large turnover in your account on their platform.\n\nIf our people are ordinary people with ordinary account activities, it will be very strange if once money enters our account immediately fat, for example 1 BTC directly. That's pretty big.\n\nI think, if the existing exchange is legal and can get permission, I think it's easy because there is a limit on the level that can be withdrawn daily and for ordinary taxes have been deducted directly when you process the sale of your BTC.","473":"Quote from: tajimas on May 25, 2024, 12:15:22 PM\nHello,friends\nThe question is more for those who once converted a lot of bitcoins into fiat to their bank accounts\nHow did you do it so that the tax authorities and the bank manager would not question where the money came from?\nThe thing is that many years ago i bought my bitcoins from a person in cash and he transferred them to me in my presence\nHow can i make sure that this money is transferred to my bank card without any problems?\n\n-Regards\n\nI don't think if other countries like mine that there's a wallet actually recieved an Bitcoin and easy to convert fiat  with lesser fee.

There are different exchanges like coinbase, Binance, kucoin that offers these services. Don't get it all wrong these exchanges do not directly buy your Bitcoin or USDT they will match you with a buyer in the exchange through the P2P area there you will see merchants and their prices.  Although the amount of taxes depends on your country of origin.\nSelling through P2P is a perfect way to avoid tax, but we need to know that the traction can be tracked if the bitcoin in question was also purchased from Coinbase before the bitcoin price pumped up and there is a little profit gained from that purchase.\n \nIf it's in the US, where bitcoin and other currencies are taxed just like other properties in the US, if it's purchased from Coinbase, there will be a capital-gained tax attached to it.\n \nYou might think you have escaped the tax system until the regulatory authorities request your details from the exchange.

I've heard of so many bank accounts being frozen by the authority because a transaction made of it seems strange and suspicious. So while some governments are being against bitcoin, it's a risk of Investors to sell such huge amount of bitcoin and get the money sent to their bank accounts because it could trigger monitoring of the account which the investors would be questioned. And in such case, the Investor could be in trouble.\nSo Op, if the government isn't against bitcoin, I don't think if it'd be a problem if you tell the bank the source where the money came from while the clue to escape that questionable fact by the bank is for the Investor to trade the amount of the huge bitcoin sequentially without running the transaction at a one spot.","480":"Quote from: tajimas on May 25, 2024, 12:15:22 PM\nHello,friends\nThe question is more for those who once converted a lot of bitcoins into fiat to their bank accounts\nHow did you do it so that the tax authorities and the bank manager would not question where the money came from?\nI think the answer to this question should vary from one county to another, because here in Nigeria, bank accounts are sub divided into more than 3 categories, that is;\n1.

An adult or business bank account, which could accumulate from #1million and above (i.e unlimited).\nSo if by mistake you happen to send money to either a kid or teenager's bank account which has limitations of a certain amount it's likely to accumulate, then in that scenario, you are likely to be asked to come do account upgrade. Which is why here, it's always good to send huge sum of money to these business or corporate bank account. So as to avoid bank managers questioning where the money came from.

In this situation, it happens to be litecoin.\n\n\nhttps:\/\/bitpay.com\/stats\/\n\nMaybe it is better this way. If people want to make payments, they can choose an alt and there are no shortage of good, cheap & fast altcoins. Litecoin, Dogecoin, XMR and even bcash is not that bad if you want to pay cheap tx fees.

But that being said, if we're considering the possible reasons behind a possible reduction in the numbers of new persons that are joining the Bitcoin network and creating new Bitcoin address after the development of the Bitcoin spot ETF and and the the whole halving event, it's either one of the following reasons.\n\n1. Most newbies that are joining the Bitcoin ecosystem in general are mostly driven into the system by hypes mostly from those that are already in the system and I guess that's why we had a lot of new persons that even joined the forum as the halving approaches because they would normally want to benefit from the whole post halving bull and I guess that is what also played out during the development of the Bitcoin spot ETF.\n\n2. Others might just be investing into different meme coin hoping that the much anticipated bull will affect the price of meme coin drastically.

Here's the BIP39 seed phrase named S1, and the 12 seed words are:\nCode:\narena brisk seminar tool risk cat despair repeat seat property cattle later\n\n2. Here's a set of two cards called CipherCard used for encryption, the black card is a data card with a lot of substitution characters laser-engraved, and the silver card is covered with cut-out holes and index characters laser-engraved.\n\n\n3. Now using the CipherCard as the picture shows to perform substitution encryption on the seed phrase S1, to get ciphertext C1 as follows:\nCode:\nURU\/Yw\nLwE~T1\nAE&8If\n4YQ8Iw\nC2Q~EE\nnvH~TE\nJEQLJY\nrEQL5U\n4wuQIw\nCT&lQ&\n&TT2&E\nK>I5ef\n\nYou can claim the prize if you can derive the substitution RULE for converting from plaintext to ciphertext based on plaintext S1, ciphertext C1, and the CipherCard mentioned above.\n\nBitcoin transaction fees will be paid out of the prize, receiving the prize is completely tax-free in some countries, while in others you will be taxed when you exchange bitcoin for local fiat currency.\n\nHere's How\nLet's assume you've tried to recover this wallet by entering S1 plaintext into Electrum or whatever software\/hardware wallet you prefer, if you're not sure about the derivation path, here's a hint:\nCode:\np2pkh\nm\/44h\/0h\/0h\n\nNow you can see that the entire balance in this wallet was spent to a 2-of-3 multisig wallet address:\nCode:\n3ARNTrr77hteEMpsR9czY9fjr3iUK4u9DJ\nAnd this is our jackpot.\n \nYou already control the first Master Private Key of this multisig wallet because you know S1, you can easily verify that the first Master Public Key is:\nCode:\nxpub6AHLobkTKhivG2iA35ky2XzXViUKKcufHQbvUEb1jkC1BPr7dGaJNqSj6jPj2QySUssXBtYDMdJezM5bxq17cH7PbRVX9fcxzgVjQ8rZwye\n\nIf you're not sure about the derivation path of this multisig wallet, here's another hint:\nCode:\np2sh\nm\/45h\/0\n\nTo create an observation wallet, the other two Master Public Keys you need are as follows:\nCode:\nxpub6ACDZ7jooxgrDb7Hdh14jYcyqL551UhLyKRvVEAcsEKVLjkdRTB9wWK3SQ6kHumHJo5Cj7NLYGo1gibDhPDba49mGAmYxYbtB7zgE3BMgk1\nCode:\nxpub6BK1kchT9yHsk6i7rsmehWeE44yqRhbyYKrBSQ1bxsPKqKdEneDykfRnqaqbB1rBjrfTgDRxnw6z3tTXecyq7gqkVBQXzfftz81mEM9nhYr\n\nBut to spend the balance of this 2-of-3 multisig wallet, you have to control at least one more private key, and the only information you can get about this second private key is the following ciphertext C2:\nCode:\nURUd53\nd(C<E^\n%ECNFS\nd[s[KS\nqFC<{(\ndFUlqq\n%JbEsp\nQ#<Eq<\n$EpJwd\nKFUNFA\n[l<#m<\nee15ef\n\nAs mentioned, you have derived the substitution RULE for converting from plaintext to ciphertext by using plaintext S1, ciphertext C1, and CipherCard, it will not be difficult to invert plaintext S2 from ciphertext C2 and CipherCard.\n\nWhen you get S1 and S2, you'd better sweep up all your prize at the first opportunity in case some other smart guy gets there first. After that, please take some time to detail your analysis process so I can improve the rules, thanks in advance.\n\nThe puzzle won't be too easy, requiring basic math knowledge about bitcoin and blockchain, a bit of patience, and a bit of luck. Yet it won't be too hard either, as you can see from the short ciphertext (compared to the plaintext), that I haven't used too many tricks to interfere with your analysis.\n\nIf you do put in a little effort but can't solve the puzzle, you can forward it to the guy you think is the smartest among the people you know and then share the prize with them.\n\nOf course sponsoring this challenge is also appreciated, and I'm really thinking about how to give the challengers and sponsors a little surprise, any offers?\n\nAdditional useful information\n\nConsidering that not having a physical card in your hand will inconvenience you in recognizing and reading the substitution table, I list all the possible combinations regarding the stacked placement of the two cards below.\n\n\n\n\nHave fun solving the puzzle, and, well, good luck!","562":"Interesting!

These passwords are used to sign up for various websites or services, and that's odd, I never thought of saving seed phrases in this way (considering I've been into bitcoin mining for 13 years now).\n\nA chance encounter made me want to share my approach to password management, and I've even written an article about this approach, which I call the \"Rule-Based Multi-Table Substitution Strong Password Management Method and Tool\". In that article I compare the password management tools available on the market and give a lot of examples to illustrate what the \"rule-based\" approach is. I claimed that the security of passwords depends on the security of the rules, not the substitution tables. Even if the information on the PassCard is made public, it still doesn't compromise the security of all my passwords, and even if it is coupled with one password compromised by a phishing attack, it doesn't compromise the security of other passwords with the same rules and the same substitution table.\n\nI realize I may have blown it a bit.\n\nUsing it myself is one scenario, and letting more people use it is another, the attack exposure increases so many times that I need to perform a more extensive security validation for the sake of prudence, but haven't been able to come up with a proper test plan.\n\nJust about 1 month ago, I happened to see Asanoha's nostr post on the Seed Cipher, which I think is a tool\/artifact related to seed phrase encryption, and he then launched a Puzzle challenge. By the way, that was a brute force cracking challenge that still has no challenger declared successful, anyone interested can learn about it from this link.\n\nThat inspired me, but there are still some differences between passwords and seed words, at the most basic level, (BIP39) seed words are limited to a 2048 word dictionary, and even including SLIP39 and Electrum, there are only 3210 selectable words, which makes brute force cracking considerably less difficult. In order to make rule-based multi-table substitution encryption work for seed words, I've made a simple upgrade to the CipherCard, which makes the two cards you just saw very different from the stainless steel one I had in my poket, and a new set of two cards (laser-cut + laser-engraved) is being customized to be received very soon, I think.\n\nSo I decided to put up 0.1 BTC to start this challenge, I'm not sure if that reward is attractive enough, after all there are hundreds of BTC worth of challenges out there. Let's see, maybe I'll pump more prizes into the pool, maybe someone else will offer a sponsorship to the pool, maybe this challenge will only survive for a week or two before it's cracked, who knows?\n\nI just hope this challenge lasts a little longer, because I need time to update my article, add chapter about seed phrases, and also replace the pictures in the article with pictures of the new CipherCard so that all the examples I've given will need to be rewritten based on the new CipherCard as well.\n\nAs I said, security depends on the rules, not the information on the card, and even if this challenge is solved, it only means that the rules I set were too simple, and maybe I'll re-initiate a more difficult challenge with more complex rules while offering higher prizes, who knows?\n\nIf luck isn't on the challenger's side, I think I'll offer to end the game at some point, reveal the real method, share the revised and finished article to make this kind of method available to everyone for free, And maybe a little extra bonus for some of the active challengers\/sponsors, who knows?","567":"Yes, I will of course follow up with some tips one by one, as I said earlier, the reverse derivation is not difficult, the point is to understand the forward process.\n\nI just wrote a paragraph to explain why this puzzle challenge exists.\nThis card was originally designed as a multi-table substitution encryption for generating multiple high-strength passwords, initially as a one-to-two mapping.\n\nBut that's not safe enough if it's going to be used for seed phrases, so this time I've upgraded to a set of two cards, and as you can see, for each index letter, that now translates to four possible substitutions, which is a one-to-four multi-table substitution.\n\nThink about it differently, what would you do if you were the one using such a one-to-four multi-table substitute encryption?\nWould you leave yourself a hint: in what way should these two cards be placed? And in what order to use the four substitution tables once they've been placed?\n\nQuote from: mohammedlaoui on April 20, 2024, 07:18:40 AM\nThe imgs are very complicated because you tell us more than one image \ud83d\ude15 can you write something or tell something \ud83e\udd14","568":"The real puzzle is to understand the puzzle.

Yes, it is enough if we have the first four letters of a word, because they are unique. So, we have more room to introduce information that will obscure these letters? For example, could URU\/Yw be \"aren\" followed by another input that is used in your rule to help us go figure out the next word?\n\nI've been looking at it since yesterday, but it's a loss of time until this point. We know absolutely nothing about your rule. It could be anything, like take the first cipher-letter ('U') and use it to find potential letters that it points given a combination using the silver and black cards (e.g., from the first of the twelve combinations, it points to 'h', 'j', 'n' and 'm'). That's just one of the nearly infinite rules I can think of.\n\nI checked an account under the nostr post you shared, from BitCat, which I presumes is yours, because they're describing a very similar patent of securing passwords.

We know that the main reason for BRICS is dedollarization but using some means to make other countries looking for ways to join the organization.\n\nHere is another dedollarization news I read not quite long: China\u2019s yuan replaces US dollar, euro as Russia\u2019s \u2018primary\u2019 foreign currency for overseas economic activity while I have been reading about BRICS mission since some years ago.\nDedollarization is the goal for BRICS currency initiative and it is for a new world order where the USD isn't a major currency for trade and transactions that is the reason for BRICS being created.\nIt's just funny sometimes when I reason out this BRICS currency issue, because the currency proposed to be used  is nothing more than the Chinese currency,  Yen.\n\nI know the price of dollar to Naira rate without think much, but the price of Bitcoin in my local fiat which is the Naira, is what I fail to know by heart unless am swapping from BTC to USD or checking the conversion rate before trading it.","592":"Quote from: stompix on April 12, 2024, 01:30:57 PM\nat least in private, do you know the price of one BTC in any other currency than the USD and your own?\nAnd when I say you know, I mean by heart, not making the exchange math in your mind, one BTC is 70k , 1 Euro is 1.1 USD so then, or something like this!\n\nJust one tiny experiment, wonder if the outcome is any different than what I imagine!\n\n\nI will tell you this run this experiment on a millions of people and the results will be the same. Although have the platforms for bitcoin price estimation with the option of getting the price in my countries currency but yet still I go dollar, because I am accustomed already to the dollar rate and I know it\u2019s not only me having this problem.\n\nIf you ask me how do I see a dedollarization, I will say it\u2019s something that isn\u2019t close a near future. The only thing I see with brics pushing this is basically just to weaken the US political power and not the currency itself. They fell this is what give them central power and since they use it against countries they place sanctions on, the BRICS might believe by introducing a new currency people will have a way round it.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s not possible but it\u2019s adoption and denouncing of dollar will still take decades from here","593":"Quote from: stompix on April 12, 2024, 01:30:57 PM\nI was just browsing around the economics section, and again full of de-dollarization, the dollar is dying, bla bla, I was curious what are the people who hate the dollar that much using instead.\nI'm from Europe and I've know bitcoin for a while, I remember that the first times I bought something of course it had to be in euros because of the bank transfer, so at that time I was checking more the price in euro without actually paying too much attention at the price in US dollars.

If an investor happens to buy Bitcoin at a high price, let's say $70k per Bitcoin, and now the price has dipped to $63k+, the investor will have to hold until the Bitcoin price spikes again and goes above their bought price.

I assume the they don't have any intention to sell their holding in this present bull season so buying at $63,700 is not a bad decision since Bitcoin will always beat it's ATH.

There is no stipulation that after a difficulty reset block that the next block must be the normal difficulty; if the next block is more than 20 minutes after the current block, then it can also have a difficulty of 1.\n\nFor blocks that are found within 20 minutes of each other, the block's difficulty will be the same as the difficulty of the last block in the difficulty interval whose difficulty was not 1 OR the difficulty of the first block in the difficulty interval. This behavior is defined here: https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/blob\/master\/src\/pow.cpp#L32.\n\nThe way that the difficulty retarget works is that, at the beginning of the new difficulty interval, the difficulty of the first block in that interval takes the difficulty of the last block in that interval and multiplies that by the time it took to mine the 2016 blocks and then divides it by the target time. The result is then clamped to be at least 1. Since this is based upon the difficulty of the last block in the previous interval, if that block is difficulty 1, then the next interval will also have a difficulty of one.\n\nSo what we are seeing here is that the last block in the interval is found 20 minutes after the block before it so it has a difficulty of one. Because the next block adjust the difficulty and it only looks at the block before it (which is difficulty 1), the difficulty of the next interval is 1. So the next 2016 blocks are mined at difficulty 1, and the difficulty then slowly adjusts up again.","700":"0.00001550 BTC (0.83 cents USD @ market rate) to just buy one Bitcoin Testnet coin in minutes https:\/\/altquick.com\/exchange\/market\/BitcoinTestnet or accountless with our swap tool https:\/\/altquick.com\/swap\/.\n\nAllowing easy access to Testnet coins will continue to keep these faucets alive that people need.

If this was happening we wouldn't see such a large negative pressure in January from GBTC because they'd sell everything OTC to other funds.\n\n\nyou should check that GBTC was offering alot of coin on the same platform as blackrock and some other ETFs\nGBTC and blackrock both use coinbase prime(part of the custody OTC suite) not the standard coinbase public exchange..  know the difference\n\nif you look at how many coins GTBC had jan 10th. compared to now. and then look at how many coin all other ETF have now compared to jan 11th.. you will see the shuffling clearer\n\nwhen you look at this\nhttps:\/\/platform.arkhamintelligence.com\/explorer\/entity\/blackrock\nhttps:\/\/platform.arkhamintelligence.com\/explorer\/entity\/grayscale\nand this\n\n\nit becomes clearer\n\nfunny thing is it was miners doing the negative pressure on the standard exchanges, because they were not part of the coinbase prime(custodian swap) deals of exiting one etf to enter the others\n\nas for your miner speak\nthe amount of coin that came from GBTC was high.. the amount of coin that came from random miners was near ZERO\n\nhowever there are some ETF that invested into marathon POOL. and they done their own closed door deals(not on public exchange) with ETFs but that amount was not as much as the deals with GBTC\n\nother miners who sell pressured in january had nothing to do with the custodian deals. and instead were just selling coin on the open spot exchange\n\nknow the difference\n\nif still unsure\nlook at this image below. notice the gray[scale] below the 0 line.. note the shape and angle of depletion.. compared to the other ETF above the 0 lines and angles of accumulation.. coincidence of consequence.. you choose\n\nnote the exact points of the 12th, 16th,19th,22nd the pattern[mirror] explains itself","713":"OP, it was clear that the majority of coin ownership would eventually shift to centralised platforms.

Some even leave their money in central services or closed-source, disreputable wallets such as freewallet. For them, investing through an ETF is much better than wasting their currencies to them. Scammers, but if you are thinking beyond investment, then surely the only real Bitcoin is the one that you (alone and no one else) has its private key.","716":"Quote from: Kakmakr on February 13, 2024, 05:22:39 PM\nNow for many people this is not a problem, because they are making good profits from the coins that are being gobbled up by the ETFs. I have no problem with that, because ownership of coins should not be restricted, but it is sad to see our coins going into centralized platforms, where people do not have control over the private keys. (The private key are controlled by the trading platform)\nThose Bitcoin Spot ETFs mostly use Coinbase as their custodian partner and this means your worry is true. Investors in those Bitcoin Spot ETFs have to trust those Bitcoin Spot ETFs and Coinbase to buy and store bitcoins transparently and handle those bitcoin safely as well as without shady activities to steal money from investors.\n\nThose investors have their money, their choices and they can make different decisions, by buying shares of Bitcoin Spot ETFs with above risk; or to buy bitcoin by themselves and be self-custodian for their bitcoins.\n\nI agree with risk you raised here and it's know by senior bitcoin investors. Not your keys, not your bitcoins.","717":"OP, as a bitcoiner, sure its sad. But as a realist, nothing wrong with it. People can use bitcoin any way they want to. People storing bitcoin in centralized ways for convenience, whether in ETFs or just having their bitcoin custodied by companies, means those services of convenience get better. Convenient services always increases adoption for a technology. Increasing adoption is good for Bitcoin. Gate-keeping Bitcoin only to purists is not good for Bitcoin. For example, if we expected everyone to run their own node and custody their own Bitcoin, Bitcoin would never be all that useful because most people would never bother owning any Bitcoin.\n\nAn analogy:\nIt'd be like if you expected everyone who owns a car to know how to do all the repairs on their own car. If that were the case not enough people would own cars to have it be worthwhile for the govt to build roads everywhere and thus transportation would be much worse which would hinder society. Sure, ideally, we all can fix our own cars, but in reality only a minority of people will be that hardcore group.\n\nNow of course key management is much easier than learning automobile repair, but its the same situation. There's going to be a certain amount of people taking full advantage of all of Bitcoin's powers - self-custody, running their own node, maybe even operating a mining machine. While there are going to be a lot more people self-custodying but not running their own node. While there will likely be even more people using an entire industry's apparatus for allowing them to own and\/or use their Bitcoin conveniently without worrying about how Bitcoin works. Sure, you lose power with convenience, but you can still be a Bitcoin participant by taking the convenient and less powerful route.\n\n\n\nHumans appreciate convenience, and people tend to have a limited amount of things or areas that they want to be 'hardcore' about. For many people they may want bitcoin but Bitcoin is not going to be one of the areas they care to become an expert in. Just like your average stock investor is just putting away a bit of money each paycheck into an index fund for retirement, rather than reading up on company quarterlies and picking stocks based on a bunch of their own research. Just like most people are going to pay someone to fix their car, even very simple things like changing a bulb or changing the oil, rather than learn about how to do it themselves. Just like, well everything, in which most people will choose to pay for convenience over needing to apply their own bandwidth to be self-sufficient, because everyone has limited bandwidth.\n\nPeople are free to use Bitcoin at any level, whether it is the ideal monetary sovereignty level taking full advantage of Bitcoin, or the \"this is just an investment held in a bank or investment firm\" level. As bitcoiners we can always recommend people the best way to have Bitcoin is to take advantage of as many of its revolutionary powers as possible, but we have to accept lots of people aren't gonna want to bother with that. And that is entirely natural and expected, and not something to fret over, or claim Bitcoin is no longer decentralized because of (as some people do). You can only control your own actions. If you hold your own Bitcoin, be proud of that, and be thankful that your self-custodied Bitcoin is becoming ever more useful as more people adopt Bitcoin in whatever way they desire, because greater adoption means greater Bitcoin acceptance and eventually we get to the point where you can largely live on a Bitcoin standard instead of a fiat standard, if that is your ideal goal.","718":"there are no issues in how people want to use bitcoin, but we should atleast strive to point out the risks and not just play promotion platitude ass kissing\n\n(people on this forum have already heard the word bitcoin to have even found this forum. so they do not need the cheerful whispers of utopian promotional recruitment speak, they are now looking for the real, factual information and risks they need to be aware of)\n\nbitcoin in CEX have no insurance. so unlike a bank you do not have the $250k FDIC insurance\nuse a CEX if you day trade where depositing\/withdrawing is a hassle but realise the risks. and note the \"you can lose all your investments\" slogan\n\nholding long term because you have no intent to sell anytime soon. its best to suggest storing on ones own private key. but note the risks of different wallet, software and what they do or dont offer\n\n..\nthose taking advantage of ETF share buys. should know although they get tax advantages whilst getting exposure to the spot price. they need to know their broker, ETF trust at their sole discretion can close the share offering. and shares are not claims to any rights to any asset held. you cannot redeem bitcoin spot ETF for actual bitcoin. you only have price exposure at a share ratio to bitcoin price based on the Nav number the ETF trust chooses and can change at their sole discretion without needing to give notice or get votes from share holders","719":"ETF this, ETF that, I think that people are now reasoning better, this is unlike how it was so lousy before the approval.

Indeed in this case trading is also quite good but it will not be able to be done by beginners who are still very high risk and I do not recommend this for beginners.","797":"One of the best things for me is that I can receive payments and make transactions seamlessly with it.\nAnother is the independence of my finance.

Instead, you can make your own insurance by saving that money.\n \nConventional insurance service is not a scam or a waste of time. You are correct that your insurance premium might become greater than the asset's cost but it helps reduce risks. The insurance company will have to pay for damages even when you have not paid enough premiums to cover the cost of settlement.

However, this doesn\u2019t mean that a 10x larger block would contain 10x more transactions or yield 10x more in fees.

So, Imagine a single block containing more than 35K transactions but all of them used less than 5 sat\/vB fee. So, If I am not wrong, the miners won't make much money.

For now, most miners would not be affected by such a change because of the coinbase fee, but what if the BTC price becomes flat in the future and the coinbase is no longer enough to support miners?\n\nMany miners have huge loans open lines of credit, so in this case since fees are also stable and not increasing, then many of them would be forced to close shop.\n\nEdit: to reach $36m a day at these prices, you'd have to find nearly 100 blocks a day.

Markets are unpredictable,\n\nSuccessful traders uses technical and fundamental analysis to analyze and predict the market direction before taking a trade, some traders like swing traders can have a certain trade setup which unless that setup shows up, they will not take any trade, that's patient and discipline. So, every trader, depending on the type of trader you are, can make profit from trading if they are using the right strategy and also sticking with that strategy, having a good risk to reward management ability, being patient and discipline and also making sure they take a trade only when all their confluences are met.\n\nSome persons would say that trading is more profitable for them than holding and some will say holding is more profitable for them, all of that depends on the ability of what you can handle. If holding is working for you, stick to it. Despite that there are many traders that are making profit from the market, even with their perfect strategy, they still get losses most of the time, that's because the market is dynamic and you can not be right about its direction all the time.\n\nThe conclusion is that, trading is profitable as much as holding. From my experience in trading crypto futures and also averaging, I would say that getting 30% off the market three or two times a week is very possible.","872":"Quote from: Novachrono2022 on December 30, 2024, 11:05:31 AM\nNow I've been in crypto since 2022.

Holding a coin for long term and placing a trade can both be profitable depending on your skills and decision making.\nBoth holding a coin for long term and placing a trade have their own risk.  For example, some people going into trading just to make quick profit without having the core understanding of the market, knowing when to place trade and when not to place trade. Contrary to this, holding a coin for a long term can only be profitable during the market bull run but after that you can predict what will happen next, whether the coin will continue to bullish or dip.","873":"My strategy is a bit of a hybrid, in that my holding online is in the form of buy and sell offers.\n\nOver the years my coins have tended to experience less activity as more and more and more coins and tokens are created, dividing the audience as it were.\n\nBack when there were only 30 or less coins to choose from they all saw a lot of activity every day.\n\nOnce there were 300 types in existence individual choices slowed down in activity.\n\nSame as more and more exchanges came online, dividing activity among them as well as among all the things they listed.\n\nSo over time my huge columns of buy and sell offers became more and more like holding, less and less like trading.\n\nFor example my BTC\/XLM pair on one exchange has experienced over 24 hours of no trades two or three times lately, with XLM price in terms of BTC hovering between my lowest sell offer and my highest buy offer.\n\nBut a few more days back it was more volatile, sometimes taking two or more of my buy offers and two or more of my sell offers by the time I woke up and re-placed my proceeds onto the other side of the order-book, replenishing my columns of offers.\n\nWith IXC\/BTC on FreiExchange just yesterday someone bought up a huge chunk of my column of sell offers, but the price there is so very low I make my buy offers column massively more \"dense\" than my column of sell offers as I know when price is near the bottom it tends to attract \"dumps\". So right now there is a big gap between my highest buy offer and my lowest sell offer although my buy offers still cover every satoshi of price down to 1 satoshi and my sell offers still cover every ten satoshis of price way up into the thousands of satoshis.\n\nSo in effect I am holding both bitcoin and IXCoin there and have been for year upon year upon year, but more and more and more of them over time, from time to time taking out some of one or both as profits to hold at home or to cash out.\n\nIn summary yes it actually works but my strategy is to blanket cover the whole range of up and down rather than just place one offer and a stop-loss or stop-gain as it were, so I gain hugely on the big sudden movements by catching them one pre-placed step at a time with my huge ladders \/ columns of steps.\n\n\n-MarkM-","874":"Quote from: Novachrono2022 on December 30, 2024, 11:05:31 AM\nNow I've been in crypto since 2022.

For example, those who trade futures have a tool like Coinglass that finds all trading positions and liquidation areas. If you take a position, they can see it and target your liquidation margin to take you out of the market.\n\nSo, if you are trading futures, be aware of this and stick to spot exchanges because the risk is minimal unless you keep set your limit order on spot because they can also see it on the order book.\n\nI also recommend that you avoid scalping and instead focus on swing trading because you are looking for mid-term or weekly price action before placing a limit order.","876":"Quote from: Novachrono2022 on December 30, 2024, 11:05:31 AM\nNow I've been in crypto since 2022.

I think in  2021 you speak of solana all time high, was also when bitcoin was also high and I think before bitcoin will climb it's ATH I believe other altcoins which had higher value and drop as bitcoin, will resurrect alongside with bitcoin.\n\nChecking from cryptographic analysis you would have noticed that all altcoin that was low in value have started gradually growing with bitcoin. Because bitcoin is there subsidiary and whatever happens to bitcoin also affects them. So I believe most altcoin will go back to its original state just as bitcoin is also going back.","897":"Previously doubted Solana when FTX experienced a decline because as far as I know FTX is a big holder of Solana and I thought they would withdraw their Solana to pay their creditors or customers.\n\nI think if this happens it will cause a bigger dump on Solana, and it seems that to this day this has not been done, instead Solana has become a concern again in the blockchain realm, new projects have emerged and have enough potential so that many investors are returning to Solana in the future, problems are going down again or not, I think it will temporarily fall again and will increase again in the next altseason.","898":"Quote from: ice18 on December 21, 2023, 04:54:54 AM\nI remember the last few months I was trading at $14 and up at $21 how I wish I did not close it very early, I should have huge profit right now seems SOL price pumped too crazy a lot of hype going on.

They are now thinking of finishing the crypto regulatory framework as soon as possible because the acceptance of crypto ETF means if public have been also accepting crypto to be a new commodity in our life.\nThe positive impact will be coming soon. I think cynthia lummis's tweet has been making everything clear. They are not working to the crypto regulations as soon as possible.\nWhat opposite reaction? When they say that ETH is an asset and not a commodity? Not sure if they mean it, I mean maybe they only use that term because each of us has also been using it and we interchanged it sometimes with currency and even a commodity, or whatever term that we can think of.\n\nThis shows how versatile cryptos are. With that being said, I think it is not a big deal if whatever term they will be using to ETH or to any other cryptos and I'm sure that both or all of them are still going to be valid.

For me, this is a plan to further weaken the crypto industry and for them to take more control, but people are not sensitive and futuristic about it. If they continue like this by dividing the crypto market unchallenged, it will get to a point later in the future that they might say they want this class of coin\/token and will clamp down on the others.\n\nFirst, they are successful in stating that Bitcoin is not a security, but by virtual of all definitions, meanings and interpretations, it shows that Bitcoin is indeed a security. Now, it is the time of Ethereum just because of the ETF filing and they've started claiming that it is a commodity ( that's if what you claim is true for I did not read it) despite Ethereum not having the characteristics of what I know as \"Commodities\" that are being traded in the financial market. These are mere ways to creep further into the crypto world so as to regulate it further.\n\nBecause with time, they will surely fight most of these cryptocurrencies and cause some never to exist anymore and also block many others from ever being created. This is a mere foundation for that, though it could take decades, but truly, it will make it easier for them to strike. However, I do not have anything against regulation and never will I, since it is helping humanity than causing pain, but for the division they are solely causing for the crypto world unchallenged.\n\nShould the US be the one to always tell the whole what a thing is and what it is not?

Any coin with a PoS mechanism will be classified as such by the US government. ETH is becoming more centralized each day, as big players (mainly CEXs) hold a large stake on the network. The ETFs approval will only make matters worse. Would you imagine an scenario where institutional investment companies become validators of the ETH blockchain with customers' stake? It'd be disastrous.\n\nThis is NOT what Satoshi wanted in the first place. People don't care because they're only focused on making money.

While several other projects emerged in that wave, USDD on Tron remains one of the few notable examples [1].\n\nInitially, USDD was designed with a diversified reserve pool, including both Bitcoin and TRX. However, recent withdrawals of nearly 12,000 BTC have left the stablecoin solely backed by TRX. This shift has raised concerns among the crypto community about the potential for a black swan event, particularly as the market nears a potential uptrend and altcoin season [2].\n\nAlthough USDD's market cap is currently lower than UST's was before its collapse (750M USD << 18B USD), the interconnectedness of the Tron ecosystem could lead to broader implications. The potential failure of USDD could have a ripple effect, even affecting the liquidity of TRC-20 USDT. While I personally avoid USDD, my holdings of USDT on Tron make me wary of these risks. As a precaution, I might explore USDC as a safer alternative.\n\nThe absence of community involvement in the Tron DAO Reserve's decision-making process contradicts the principles of decentralized governance. Given Justin Sun's track record of unreliability, I am not surprised by this outcome. The lack of trust in the project's leadership has dissuaded me from investing in TRX, even during its extended period of price recovery.\n\n\nI want to know your opinion on this issue:\nDo you believe in the future of algorithmic stablecoins?\nAre you still using USDD or other algorithmic stablecoins?\nIf it collapses, could USDD negatively impact the entire crypto market?\nReferences:\n[1] Algorithmic Stablecoin Tokens\n[2] Justin Sun's USDD stablecoin is no longer backed by bitcoin","1146":"USDD does not use mechanisms where TRX is minted or burned to stabilize the price of USDD.

However, the platform's development trajectory remains robust, with significant strides being made in preparation for the transformative Hydra and Chang hard forks.\n\nAs a Cardano sidechain, Hydra processes numerous transactions off-chain, significantly enhancing the mainnet's performance. This scalability improvement positions Cardano to accommodate a broader user base and diverse use cases, such as DeFi and supply chain logistics.\nBy introducing stake delegation to stake pools, the Chang hard fork aims to distribute the control of the Cardano network more widely. This increased decentralization empowers a larger portion of the community to participate in the network's governance.\n\n\u201cAfter Chang Hard Fork and Hydra, Cardano will be unstoppable. Highest decentralization and unlimited transaction speed while also having one of the highest security,\u201d Cardano advocate Ssebi stated. [1]\n\nCardano has historically shown resilience to congestion, aside from notable exceptions like the SundaeSwap launch [2]. While increased decentralization is a long-term goal, the imminent implementation of Layer-2 Hydra is the primary catalyst for renewed investor interest in ADA. This scaling solution aligns with the industry's current focus and is poised to significantly enhance the network's capacity.\n\nThis positive development could bolster Cardano's user base, providing support for ADA price.

[1]\n\nThis spot ETH ETF is expected to trigger a chain reaction of positive outcomes:\n\n1. A more bullish sentiment within the crypto community.\n2. An influx of new investors and capital into the market.\n3. The creation of new spot ETFs for various Proof-of-Stake tokens, with SOL and XRP being the frontrunners.\n4. A potential altseason marked by widespread price increases across the cryptocurrency market, culminating in a substantial rise in the total market cap.\n\nThe introduction of a spot ETH ETF alongside a spot BTC ETF presents a strategic opportunity to attract traditional investors to the crypto market. This could be a turning point, accelerating the transition from the current re-accumulation phase to a sustained period of growth.\n\nI would like to know your opinion on this issue:\nDo you think the spot ETH ETF will be as successful as the spot BTC ETF?\nDo you have high expectation for the positive impact that spot ETH ETF can bring to the crypto market?\nAre you holding ETH and waiting for ETH price increase after this news?\nReferences:\n[1] SEC Tells ETH ETF Issuers Fund Can Start Trading Next Tuesday: Sources","1176":"When ethereum itself do follow bitcoin price.

There have been times when ETH price have followed a different trajectory. The same might be happening here because once those ETF inflows start coming in for ETH, it would mean more buy price on ETH.

It depends on how deeply interested institutional investors are in Ethereum. Capital inflows between the spot BTC ETFs and the spot ETH ETFs will tell you which is most successful. I've read about many companies filing for spot ETH ETFs, so it looks like things are going to be bright for the cryptocurrency.\n\nPersonally, I hold less than 1 ETH in my portfolio. I'm planning to buy more before the next \"pump\". It's likely altcoins will go to the moon, once ETH spot ETFs get the \"green light\" from the SEC. Especially ETH-based tokens (ERC-20).

I don't think ETH ETF will be as successful as bitcoin. The reason is clear. Ethereum can't leave bitcoin's movement. As long as Ethereum keeps following it, it will be stuck. Things may change if the ETF buys hundreds of thousands of Ethereum from the market. But, the impact may not be as big as bitcoin's did.\nAgain, Ethereum's deflation is also getting slower. This is due to the lack of transactions in the blockchain. This is also inflating the total supply of Ethereum itself. It's very hard to say Ethereum's price will be surge more than 50% like what Bitcoin did. Ethereum's trend still follows bitcoin.\n\n2. I don't expect much from ETH ETFs. And again, this can't have a huge impact on all crypto. Ethereum is the only coin that will benefit from the launch of ETH ETF. This is pretty much the same as bitcoin's case. Look at how altcoins are always getting eaten by bitcoin.\nPeople are slowly moving their money only to the BTC, and probably ETH ETF makes it worst. The demand for altcoins will be less.\n\n3. I've sold all of Ethereum at the peak price. Buy the rumors and sell for the news. I don't mind how big Ethereum will increase, and i can still enter the party through future trades. It's very obvious people will sell their Ethereum after the launch of ETH ETF.","1190":"Quote from: Vincom on July 17, 2024, 07:45:19 AM\nI would like to know your opinion on this issue:\nDo you think the spot ETH ETF will be as successful as the spot BTC ETF?\nDo you have high expectation for the positive impact that spot ETH ETF can bring to the crypto market?\nAre you holding ETH and waiting for ETH price increase after this news?\nETH doesn't have to have an ETF as successful as BTC, because lets face it Bitcoins name is a lot bigger for the group that would fail to buy btc themselves and only use an ETF to get it. So, obviously it will not get something that big, and that is understandable and normal. However, we need to realize that it is not going to be something that will take a while, we just need to make sure that we deal with something that is going to be fine, and that is the most important part.\n\nI personally believe that if we give it some time, we are going to deal with something that will take a while. The issue here is that we are going to deal with a lot of people who will face tough situations, and not really deal with anything that will give us any benefit at all. I think if you see ETH as something of a \"king of alts\" then you will realize that, we have a chance, it could be small, but there could be some altseason that happens, like maybe 100% max, not those 10x types, but it will still be good.\n\nThis is why I believe that we should keep our hopes high, lets wait for it to happen and be ready for an increase, at worst case it can't cause the alt prices to go down, so it is not going to be too bad at all.","1191":"Quote from: Wysi on July 22, 2024, 06:47:54 AM\nAfter years of regulatory pushback and countless amended registration filings, spot Ether Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are finally hitting the market.\n\nThe anticipated listings are a defining moment for cryptocurrency markets.\n\nSpot ETH ETF launch could cause rally in Altcoins due to their high correlation with Ethereum.\n\nRising Ethereum price could boost other Altcoins, differentiating this situation from the Bitcoin ETF launch, which saw Altcoins struggle. \n\nI wouldn't get my hopes too high.

But if we look at Bitcoin's ETF approval, the same thing happen, it takes month before we suddenly see the positive effect on this news on the market and this is what it triggers a new all time high prior to the halving. So it's better to just continue what we have done before, buy and accumulate and then HODL, simply as that. If by chance the Ethereum market catches up with the hype of ETF then maybe we will see a huge spike in the price. And we are in the bull run season as well, so most likely we will see the price slowly increasing and who knows, maybe next year not just Ethereum, but the whole crypto market is enjoying a good run and majority of the coins are hitting their new all time high.","1193":"No content","1194":"I have been on the look for a very cheap and fast way to do some cross-bridging between Ethereum and Layer 2 networks without using risky third-party bridges?","1195":"I would suggest the gateways or bridges from Optimism or Arbitrum, they are supported, well-known and provide secure ways to do what you need.","1196":"Quote from: VicManton on July 18, 2024, 12:12:05 PM\nI have been on the look for a very cheap and fast way to do some cross-bridging between Ethereum and Layer 2 networks without using risky third-party bridges?\n\nProbably zklink.. one of the feature is native asset aggregation.

Michael, with bated breath, watched as The Crypto Retriever remotely navigated his computer. The digital vault that was dogechain.info unfurled before them, revealing a hoard of $1.6 million\u2014a fortune that had silently burgeoned as the world above continued its hustle and bustle.\n\nTears of joy and disbelief streamed down Michael's face as he realized the magnitude of his newfound wealth. The weight of financial burdens lifted, and the doors to new possibilities flung open. In a grand gesture of gratitude, he awarded The Crypto Retriever with a quarter of his digital gold, a fitting tribute to their skill and perseverance.\n\nMichael Cowin Nakamoto's tale is one of modern-day alchemy, where forgotten digital coins transformed into a life-altering bounty.

Introducing MNN, a cutting-edge digital currency that promises to revolutionize the industry with its innovative features and ambitious vision.\n\nThe Rise of Zephyr (ZEPH)\nBefore delving into MNN's potential, it's essential to understand the significance of Zephyr (ZEPH). Launched in 2020, ZEPH quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, thanks to its robust security measures, fast transaction speeds, and scalability. ZEPH's market capitalization has soared, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nChallenging the Status Quo: MNN's Bold Approach\nMNN, short for \"Monetary Network Nexus,\" is a decentralized cryptocurrency that aims to address some of the limitations and challenges faced by existing digital currencies, including Zephyr. Developed by a team of experienced blockchain engineers and financial experts, MNN incorporates advanced technologies and innovative concepts to create a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nOne of MNN's key features is its unique consensus mechanism, which combines elements of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to achieve optimal security and energy efficiency. This hybrid approach aims to mitigate the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW algorithms while maintaining the robustness and decentralization offered by PoS systems.\n\nFurthermore, MNN boasts lightning-fast transaction speeds, enabling near-instantaneous transfers and settlements. This crucial aspect addresses one of the major bottlenecks faced by many existing cryptocurrencies, making MNN an attractive option for everyday transactions and widespread adoption.\n\nThe MNN ecosystem also introduces innovative features designed to enhance user experience and promote wider adoption. These include a user-friendly mobile wallet, seamless integration with traditional payment systems, and a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) built on the MNN blockchain.\n\nThe Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities\nWhile MNN's ambitious goals and innovative features hold immense promise, it faces significant challenges in dethroning the established dominance of Zephyr and other major cryptocurrencies. Building a strong user base, fostering widespread adoption, and gaining the trust of investors and regulatory bodies are crucial steps in MNN's journey to the forefront of the crypto market.\n\nHowever, the cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, and disruptive innovations like MNN have the potential to reshape the industry. As the world becomes increasingly digitized and decentralized, the demand for efficient, secure, and user-friendly digital currencies is likely to surge, creating opportunities for newcomers like MNN to stake their claim in the ever-expanding crypto universe.\n\nOnly time will tell if MNN can live up to its ambitious goals and truly challenge the reign of Zephyr and other established cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, the emergence of innovative projects like MNN is a testament to the dynamism and creativity that fuel the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.","1408":"No content","1409":"I've been obsessed with gaming lately, and I'm all about the 'play-to-earn' trend.

They had a huge unlock that was supposed to happened in March, but was pushed back after their community members raised concerns about the impact a hefty unlock like that would do to the short price movement. Among all \"major\" L2s, Starknet is one of the least used and before the dencun upgrade, it was one of the most expensive L2.\n\nMy bias: Can't and won't be showing up (won't buy). At $2, the FDV of starknet is around $20B, at most, the price can only do like a 100% or probably less since the interest is split among other L2s. I can trade it short term on futures though. Not worthy of holding for me.\n\nEtherFi: For this one, my reply will be biased because I'm a holder. EtherFi is the top LRT protocol on EigenLayer and they have tons of really good backers, will only 1B total supply and only around 12% in circulation means that there's plenty of opportunities for this to grow. ETHFI reminds me of the Celestia (TIA) run 4 months ago.\n\nBias: Premarket price was $5 and above and is trading below $3.7. I reckon that the price should soon put premarket buyers in the green and with EigenLayer launching soon and AVS projects doing some sorts of airdrop for EtherFi (the protocol or token), then it is a good buy for me especially in a full blown parabolic crypto run with restaking narrative going haywire.","1450":"I don\u2019t know much about etherfi other than the fact that it has been here quite a long time.\n\nOn the other hand, starknet is a new project that has some really clear objectives from the development team implying that they know what they are doing and has clear plans on how to do them.

It's crazy how the small players on ethereum Mainnet have all been driven away. Even ethereum transaction costs far exceeds that of Bitcoin. BTC\n\nSo to recap:\nDo a change now swap.

On the other hand if SEC approve ETH ETF before the deadline which is likely to happen, then there is a chance to get to that level as all of those ETF managers will start accumulating ETH from the market and ETH staking and eigenlayer protocol already locked up a portion of the circulating supply of ETH so a supply shock can happen in here as well.","1507":"NO\n \n\nethereum will definitely reach that amount of price but i do not think it will be happening any time soon the price increasing that much for a short period of time can bear a few sequences at the end","1508":"Quote from: bitterguy28 on March 05, 2024, 09:39:52 PM\nNO\n \n\nethereum will definitely reach that amount of price but i do not think it will be happening any time soon the price increasing that much for a short period of time can bear a few sequences at the end\nI mean, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high, so why not? \n\nAnyway, time will tell whether Ethereum will get to $4,891 or not, but I prefer to give it more time rather than just this month.

Not only its price has reached too far, but also its popularity globally amazes everyone. No one would thought in the first place that bitcoin will be this hyped and trending, but we all know the excellent potentials of bitcoin, so it's not surprising at all. There's still a lot of positive updates await for bitcoin, and we as bitcoiners, should always look forward for a brighter future waiting ahead of us.","2":"I would say Bitcoin has exceeded my expectations because in the beginning I knew Bitcoin is a very volatile and prices cannot be predicted accurately 100 percent so to now see my portfolio worth a lot more than when I bought my first bitcoins gives me so much joy.","3":"My question to you is when you look back and see how far you have come in your Bitcoin journey and based on your reason for buying your first bitcoin , would you say that Bitcoin has met or exceeded your expectations? This has clearly given something beyond my expectations at that time. Despite having sold at a fairly cheap price, some mistakes have been corrected over time, which increasingly believes that investing in Bitcoin in the long term will provide extraordinary benefits. Just imagine we used to be from the lower class with mediocre finances but little by little were able to step up to improve our fate and that was thanks to Bitcoin which provided a bridge to achieve it.","4":"You've been holding Bitcoin for many years and have been very active in the community.

So for someone like me, u may have spent few month's and year in this community but I have been aggressive in my bitcoin accumulation, and I hardly will spend out of my bitcoin holding which is what help's my total accumulated bitcoin.","5":"Everyone experience is not the same, it will surprise you that, we still have some old members of this forum who still struggle to hold a fraction of bitcoin for long period of time without exchanging them to meet one life responsibility or the others, such forum old timers can not have experience of what you are saying, but on another hand we may still have a newbies who entered into the space with the last two years and are able to accumulate enough bitcoin that have place them on a stable financial condition and freedom which is what bitcoin is all about.

This is actually different from the perspective of the post, OP is simply asking maybe bitcoin has meet your expectations or exceeded those expectations you set out for it, a act of selling off either in short term or long term doesn\u2019t actually stops one from getting his expectations either satisfied or disappointed. A short term holder can have his expectations in those period be met too, they could be aiming for a certain percentage pump and still get it or even more. As for me my expectations were to how it will handle the situation of manipulation and seriously overcoming it has been a thing that actually has exceeded my expectations, also the reduced volatility was something I envisioned and currently it is meeting it gradually","6":"As far as the price is concerned, it has exceeded my expectation, a lot. When I first purchased Bitcoin, the price was much cheaper, less than a thousand, around $500. Never in my wild yet optimistic imagination that it would even hit $10,000. But then it even reached $20,000 just a little more than a year later. Today, it's above $71,000. But as far as my idealistic imagination of a decentralized online money is concerned, it hasn't met my expectations. When I first tried to understand Bitcoin, I was thinking of a revolutionary internet currency. But I was made to realize very early how this isn't that easy to happen because of transaction fees.","7":"Yes, Bitcoin has exceeded my expectations because I never though that Bitcon can reach $20k or even $73k. The first time I see Bitcoin reach $20k, I just though that \"Wow, it is a big big big dream for me that what I did before can gives me a big profit\" so I feels excited to continue what I did. I am sure that Bitcoin investors never though as me. Those who bought below $1 really made a big profit. We really never expect that Bitcoin can be like today so I am sure Bitcoin investors will still continue what they do. Besides that, Bitcoin can be a legacy to their family.","8":"Honestly I didn't put any expectation in Bitcoin, even though I invest a lot, like 80% of my salary in Bitcoin. It's good to see Bitcoin price rise from $20K to $70K, but I don't have a lot money to invest all at once, instead I DCA-ing. The average return is close to 2x from the amount I've invested, it's a good return, but it still not able to change my life. I know Bitcoin is one of safest investment that perform better than other assets, but I feel it's still not enough.","9":"You've been holding Bitcoin for many years and have been very active in the community. My question to you is when you look back and see how far you have come in your Bitcoin journey and based on your reason for buying your first bitcoin , would you say that Bitcoin has met or exceeded your expectations? I got involved in bitcoin when it was already valuable value so the expectations have fulfilled the desire for freedom. Bitcoin provides great hope for every individual who wants to find freedom and bitcoin can provide hope for people who want to improve the income system for the better. Today we can see how the movement of bitcoin is going beyond and bitcoin is becoming one of the best investments in terms of preserving value. Believe it or not bitcoin is becoming a potential hope today and even people who are not familiar with it will increasingly understand that bitcoin is one of the best investments that can provide financial benefits if executed correctly.","10":"You've been holding Bitcoin for many years and have been very active in the community. My question to you is when you look back and see how far you have come in your Bitcoin journey and based on your reason for buying your first bitcoin , would you say that Bitcoin has met or exceeded your expectations? Yes. Even from before and I saw my money grow even just a little bit really justified my decision to buy bitcoin. Up until now despite many corrections and fud going around, I never doubted continuing holding my bitcoin. I saw progress, I saw results and I am confident that I will continue to see results in the future as well. As of now, I am very happy with my holdings of course if I could I\u2019d buy more but right now my plan is to just keep holding","11":"You've been holding Bitcoin for many years and have been very active in the community. My question to you is when you look back and see how far you have come in your Bitcoin journey and based on your reason for buying your first bitcoin , would you say that Bitcoin has met or exceeded your expectations? Bitcoin itself performs very well since 2009, and this chart of Bitcoin profitable days shows a clear fact that if Bitcoin buyers bought bitcoin and hold it for a long time, they are in profit now. Reality is different, many Bitcoin buyers bought and sold their bitcoins and they're disappointed now, not with Bitcoin performance, but with their bad decisions in the past by don't have enough belief and patience to hold their bitcoins. Don't be like them, hold your bitcoins.","12":"You've been holding Bitcoin for many years and have been very active in the community. My question to you is when you look back and see how far you have come in your Bitcoin journey and based on your reason for buying your first bitcoin , would you say that Bitcoin has met or exceeded your expectations? Honestly, it went way beyond what I expected. When I first got into Bitcoin, I had doubts too..I couldn\u2019t help but think it might just be another Ponzi scheme. Back then, I was new and only knew what I read from other people's comments, without really understanding how Bitcoin worked. But once I got to understand the system, that\u2019s when I felt more confident about holding it. I have cashed out some of my holdings, though....not everything, just enough to enjoy the bull run a bit. And I\u2019m probably gonna cash out a bit more soon; just waiting for Bitcoin to hit $100k, and then I\u2019m good. The thing is, no one holds long-term without enjoying some profit. Even though I\u2019ve cashed out a little, I know I\u2019ll buy again once the bear market is back. For me, it\u2019s all just part of the cycle - that\u2019s my mindset on how it works. But in the big picture, I understand Bitcoin is going up.","13":"Honestly, it went way beyond what I expected.

But once I got to understand the system, that\u2019s when I felt more confident about holding it. Same here. To be fair, I didn\u2019t think that it was a scam seeing how it has performed over the years. But I never just thought of it as a good investment option back then. I just thought that there\u2019s no way I could earn a lot seeing how expensive bitcoin has gotten now. But then I learned to do DCA and I would say that bitcoin has indeed exceeded my expectations and I am excited for more.

And I\u2019m probably gonna cash out a bit more soon; just waiting for Bitcoin to hit $100k, and then I\u2019m good. We all have our own plans and approach to bitcoin. If you think you have earned enough, nothing wrong with trying to enjoy some earned money. Let\u2019s make use of the bull run, yeah?","14":"You've been holding Bitcoin for many years and have been very active in the community. My question to you is when you look back and see how far you have come in your Bitcoin journey and based on your reason for buying your first bitcoin , would you say that Bitcoin has met or exceeded your expectations? For me, yes, I learned a lot when I started to own Bitcoin, it's not only the investment returns I gained, but with lessons on how money works, and how the financial system works and I started to value money or budget things on me. Bitcoin for me is not only for investment but overall, although most people are only in Bitcoin because of profits or easy money and some of them are losing money because of some greediness.","15":"First time I read about Bitcoin and it got me into Bitcoin was on a random forum talking about how you can use it to may payments online. Well I expected to see a decentralized censorship resistance payment system from day one and Bitcoin has always been that so obviously my expectations were met. My expectations weren't exactly about price and profit. But of course I started with Bitcoin when price was about $400 back in 2014 and interestingly enough price got dumped after that and went as low as $150 and I never flinched And today the price is 46500% higher than that bottom","16":"I wasn\u2019t expecting much at first, but seeing how bullish everyone was in the forums, I just went along with the hype. Since I stayed active here, Bitcoin helped me dive into the whole crypto market, and it really opened my eyes to all the opportunities out there. Most of my investments are in Bitcoin, but I can't deny that I made some good profits with altcoins back then too - it just boosted my gains to levels I never imagined before getting into Bitcoin. I\u2019m proud to be among the semi-early adopters. I started in 2016 when Bitcoin was still pretty cheap (was around $400) compared to now, and 2017 was the first bull run I experienced... I\u2019ll never forget that.","17":"You've been holding Bitcoin for many years and have been very active in the community. My question to you is when you look back and see how far you have come in your Bitcoin journey and based on your reason for buying your first bitcoin , would you say that Bitcoin has met or exceeded your expectations? It's obvious that it has exceed our expectations, we never thought that we will see this magical run, specially that I really become active like 7-8 years ago and seeing it's tremendous growth throughout the years, I never see that we are going to have this kind of adoption, growth specially during the covid-19 lockdown. And it really shows what is the future for Bitcoin, it's so resilient already even with the worst turmoil in human history in the last century or so. And most likely during the last 4 years, there are individuals who invest on it because of that, and now they could also be very happy that they might that jump as we have seen a new all time high and we could exceed that $100k that has been predicted since the start of the bull run.","18":"Yes, the expectations are meeting the demand, I would say Nothing wrong goes with BTC, and with the knowledge from the forum and great forum members, it becomes obvious what truly makes BTC so special.","19":"I wasn\u2019t expecting much at first, but seeing how bullish everyone was in the forums, I just went along with the hype.

An inheritance tax is maxed out at 55%, so, if we combine inheritance tax, income tax and local resident tax, the person who got crypto as an inheritance will pay up to 110% taxes, which means that you pay 10% more than what you got. Recently, Italy increased tax on crypto from 26% to 42%, Denmark also has up to 52% tax on crypto gains as far as I know.

When governments set such huge tax percentages, they lead citizens to tax evasion. They know it and they willingly try to earn as much as they can from the lawful citizens, whereas they allow the rest to enjoy huge profits. Life is life...","23":"Hmmm, interesting... since they can\u2019t outright ban it, they slap huge taxes on it to discourage people from using it. It\u2019s like a sin tax, similar to those on things the government considers \"not beneficial\" to us. This feels like the centralized government\u2019s way of trying to undermine Bitcoin (decentralized) by using taxes as a tool. But do we get upset about it? Not really, because we always find ways to navigate around these taxes, knowing they\u2019re not exactly fair.","24":"When governments set such huge tax percentages, they lead citizens to tax evasion. And that's our way of expressing our disagreement with the injustice they\u2019re committing. A 110% tax is completely unreasonable as it feels like they don\u2019t want us to benefit from the profits of holding Bitcoin. Some governments even impose what they call \"unrealized gains\" taxes, requiring investors to pay taxes just for holding Bitcoin as long as the price goes up. That kind of tax is absurd and does nothing to encourage adoption.","25":"And that's our way of expressing our disagreement with the injustice they\u2019re committing.

In Japan, if you sell a crypto, you have to pay 55% any gain you make from it but that's not the end of nightmare, that's the start and a true nightmare starts when you receive a crypto inheritance. Well, what can I say. This is greed and short-sightedness on the part of governments in some countries. Or is it discrimination? To scare the population from investing in crypto. If citizens of a country become richer, this makes the country richer. Isn't that so? A (hypothetical) solution suggests itself for residents of Japan: indicate the minimum period of purchase and sale of crypto and show the minimum yield, with which the minimum increase in profit (in percent). And from this minimum profit, say 1-5%, pay 55% in taxes (will amount to a conditional 1.5-7% of the total investment). I'm not sure that this will be easy to implement in terms of tax reporting, but what else can you do if the regulator invents inadequate taxes. Or you can do it differently - move to a country with 0% taxation of profits from cryptocurrencies. This is exactly how it should be done, so that countries greedy for cryptocurrency taxes get nothing. An inheritance tax is maxed out at 55%, so, if we combine inheritance tax, income tax and local resident tax, the person who got crypto as an inheritance will pay up to 110% taxes, which means that you pay 10% more than what you got. The more the regulator makes life difficult for bitcoiners, the more ways bitcoiners will find to simplify life. These are not the people you can simply milk, because it is now easy to change your country of residence. And this will create capital outflow.

The world is going crazy, especially the government which thinks that we don't have a right to make profit, they want us to be enslaved to monthly salaries. In such cases, I have a question: if governments want our taxes, are they ready to compensate for the losses incurred when investing in crypto? I lost some money on shitcoins.

It shouldn't be this way. I don't live in Japan, but here in the EU you don't add income tax to inheritance tax because inheritance is not income. You pay only one of them depending on the situation. Let's say someone in your family gives you bitcoin, you have to pay income tax, but if that person dies and leaves you bitcoin in his last will, you only pay inheritance tax. Maybe you're wrong about that interpretation? I've never heard of anyone ever having to pay income tax after already paying inheritance tax. Also, in most countries inheritance from your closest family like parents and siblings is taxed at the lowest possible rate. Also, it's worth mentioning that 55% is paid only if you inherit over 600 million JPY, which is close to 4m USD. Most of us will never see such money.","28":"Bitcoin taxes in Japan is 15% to 55% depending on your tax bracket. 55% applies only to the highest tax bracket. So the average Japanese would be paying more like 20 to 30%. In Italy they are still paying 26% because the 42% proposal did not pass.","29":"I couldn't believe what I read but it's true.

This tax is simply a way of discouraging citizens from investing in cryptocurrencies. This kind of stringent laws would encourage people to avoid or even invade tax thereby reducing the income the government would have gotten if the tax was moderate. No wonder many investors and businesses are moving to the United Arab Emirates. The Emirate has some of the most flexible tax laws that can make businesses flourish.","32":"This has to be clickbait in my opinion. I've never seen a tax code where it can be justifiably asserted that taxes end up being more than 100%. If you inherit something in terms of real estate property or cash, you get taxed on its value. But if it's something exchanged at capital markets it doesn't mean it's the same as property. This is why many wealthy families hoard wealth in the form of stock. They're the ones who have written the rules. So I think you don't have to lay both but only one. Either capital gains or inheritence but not both. Because if you inherit something and get taxed, then this is your acquisition price. Anyway. Japan is free to set its tax rates as it wants. If the people of the country owning crypto ad very much against this then let them vote for a different government. Or at least they should find ways to keep their earnings with crypto underground","33":"I couldn't believe what I read but it's true.

Different countries have different tax policies on different things like capital gain, inheritance. Highest and Lowest cryptocurrency tax countries. Rank Country Tax rate 1 Japan Up to 55% 2 Belgium Up to 50% 3 Canada Up to 33% 4 United States 0% - 37% 5 United Kingdom Up to 45% 6 Spain Up to 47% 7 Denmark Up to 52.1% 8 Netherlands Up to 49.5% 9 South Africa Up to 45% 10 Ireland Up to 40% 11 Israel Up to 53% 12 Austria Up to 55% 13 Italy Up to 43% 14 Norway Up to 22% 15 India 30% flat tax on crypto assets + 4% cess + surcharges + 1% TDS 16 France Up to 45%","34":"This seems to me more like disabling something and making it practically useless, rather than banning it altogether. When you look at it, it's not forbidden to sell Bitcoin and make a profit, but the tax is so high that nobody will want to do it in that country and they will do it in different ways. In our country, the customs law has changed many times this year. Currently, when any cargo arrives from abroad, it's not possible to pass it through customs if the value of the product is over \u20ac30 including the shipping fee. In fact, they didn't completely ban shopping from abroad, but they put such an absurd limitation that this regulation is practically no different from a ban. What Japan is doing is similar to this.","35":"I couldn't believe what I read but it's true.

I hate taxes, but such high tax levels should be applied only to the rich people. Imagine having only several thousands dollars(or yen) worth of crypto and having to pay 55% or 110% over such small amount. The people with less crypto savings should pay less taxes, while the ultra-rich should pay big inheritance and capital gains taxes.

It will encourage people to find ways to evade tax. As simple as that! Japan was the first country in the world to legalize cryptocurrency but it never made any impact probably because of such high taxes.

Because I would be simply stupid to even contemplate receiving -10 percent of my inheritance. Pay the Government to receive nothing! It is a Scam no matter how you look at it. It is obvious families will try their best to hide the inheritance or find ways to avoid the Tax. But this seems to happen with every thing around us. When everybody thought of Bitcoiners as Criminals, some fellow programmers put together foundations of ways to improve and have Privacy with Bitcoin. This only led to more people hiding if anything. When they started to introduce back doors into communication software, they created an opportunity for the most private communication software to be created and released to the public. When they became so keen on supervising all and every Bank Account transfer and Card payment as if each and every one of us were born Criminals, they launched an opportunity for more people to Withdraw Cash and use it Anonymously. This made more people hide from their system. I agree the number of people opposing the new rules and supervision is way too low however. They probably do not care much about the few of us who care. Numbers speak and they are likely more happy to have control over more people while a few others escape out of the radar than have little control over almost everybody. Governments are almost never there for us. They only lie well enough for most people to think that way.","40":"I couldn't believe what I read but it's true.

Since the beginning I've always seen cryptos as an instrument of liberation from government slavery and the tiranny of central banks and an empowering tool for the poorest. Yes I'm glad BTC has become more valuable with time but I'm in firstly because I always intended it as an instrument to build a better world. Above green candles I'm more glad when I see an interview with a poor guy from africa using btc for micropayment or a pakistani woman using it to free herself from a system that would otherwise repress her. During all of these years I've been always skeptical about the different random guys shouting and putting themselves as great defender of btc from Peter McCormack, to bitcoinboy, from Tone Ways to any possible other person which acts as influencer. When there was the blocksize war I put myself in the middle between Roger Ver and Jimmy Song but with time I've built a maximalist portfolio mainly with btc. I also \"hodl\" eth and xmr. Now that btc has gone mainstream it looks to be the time to newer big players and cryptos have become only as a way to make money from BlackRock to Microstrategy. It looks everyone is forgiving where we are coming from. Not to mention people like trump who once called btc a scam. The old ideals and the utopia for a better future are becoming only a rich scheme. I've recently watched an interview with this new big idol Michael Saylor saying that 300k fee per transaction is ok and I'm losing my faith in btc. I fear we are going into a direction where one day (if not even now) we'll be hostage of these big players overtaking the community ideals despite any decentralization.

It would be good if the fee is not going more than 10 sat\/vbyte. Also there is nothing to be worried about the institutional investors.

Good to know that you have been into Bitcoin since 2013. Since the beginning I've always seen cryptos as an instrument of liberation from government slavery and the tiranny of central banks and an empowering tool for the poorest. I do not know how the poorest will benefit as he will not have money in 2024 to buy Bitcoin. I do agree with your previous statement and I feel Bitcoin is still the one which will liberate us from financial institution but not the government. Above green candles I'm more glad when I see an interview with a poor guy from africa using btc for micropayment or a pakistani woman using it to free herself from a system that would otherwise repress her. Why only Africa or Pakistan why not think about countries in other continents where Bitcoin can change the lives of many people living in bad conditions? In the US itself, there are so many homeless and there are many who cannot afford to pay their bills even after working two shifts or even three. Do not conclude that Bitcoin can help or is meant for those citizens from particular countries or continents that are filled with corrupt leaders. Now that btc has gone mainstream it looks to be the time to newer big players and cryptos have become only as a way to make money from BlackRock to Microstrategy. Everyone now wants a piece of Bitcoin and I guess this is what is called hype which will lead Bitcoin to a new ATH. We have already observed year after year Bitcoin reaching new higher price points, it is happening because new guys or organizations are now going for it. We cannot stop them as we do not have that kind of money but eventually, it will help in Bitcoin's adoption.","53":"Bitcoin's decentralized blockchain means no one can really decide on where it goes. Sure, these big institutions like BlackRock and Michael Saylor might shake things up a bit, but places like Africa and Pakistan are still showing us how useful Bitcoin can be for folks without banking options. Instead of losing faith, we should support projects and communities that focus on Bitcoin original mission which is decentralization and freedom of global finance system. The potential of the technology to enable privacy and inclusivity is quite strong, especially in the underserved regions. Bitcoin original purpose are not dying, it's just evolving with Bitcoin into its growing role in the increasingly complex global financial system.","54":"Bitcoin's decentralized blockchain means no one can really decide on where it goes.

Bitcoin original purpose are not dying, it's just evolving with Bitcoin into its growing role in the increasingly complex global financial system. Truly, I agree with you. BTC can't stay in the shape in the minds of people that it was a year ago or a decade ago - it slightly follows the path of adoption in the world, and there are still obstacles to fight and look through to see it victorious. It is still the most decentralized coin out there, and it still follows its core principles. Let it stay that way.","55":"It's just that the fact that BTC is there got into the heads of entities that never considered it beforehand - now they take notes and see what's in store.

It has been concerning somehow as for personal holders who own only a friction of Bitcoin, but upon consideration on how free market works, there is no stopping them also, it is the nature of free market and capitalism, whether we like it or not, we have to accept this fact","56":"It's just that the fact that BTC is there got into the heads of entities that never considered it beforehand - now they take notes and see what's in store.

Nothing. Because BTC is intended for everybody willing to learn about it or believe in it. Better if both.","57":"BTC was not created for any particular type of people, i see you mentioning Africa more than once there, BTC was not created for Africans or just the poor, BTC is freedom and anybody is free to use BTC. Do you want to stop someone from using BTC, because you feel they don't deserve to use it? You forget that BTC is censorship resistant; so you can't do that. BTC is not dying, there is no need bringing up this kind of topic as so many people have already done so before. Use BTC in the way you want to, and let the next person do the same. If you are 'worried' about BTC, contribute to the network in your own way, i.e. by running a full node and use p2p services.","58":"I fear we are going into a direction where one day (if not even now) we'll be hostage of these big players overtaking the community ideals despite any decentralization. I can relate a bit to your feelings, however, I'm still more optimistic. The \"get rich quick\" sentiment is nothing new by the way; the novelty is the major institutional involvement. Bitcoin has a quite complex system of checks and balances. If a single big player like Saylor tried to change something fundamentally, e.g. proposing a protocol upgrade and executing pressure on Bitcoin Core developers, then it is still likely that many other actors would reject that upgrade if it is directed against decentralization. An actor wanting to change something has not only to convince the Bitcoin Core devs, but also miners and minor holders. He can of course code his own client, but the 2016\/2017 blocksize war showed that this approach is very likely to fail. Still I think the community should stay alert, because that equilibrium is not impossible to change. The cypherpunk values should always be reminded and held up, also by social media influencers. I think this is still the case, judging also by the positive feedback the \"OGs\" (Greg Maxwell etc.) get when they appear here in the forum. My biggest worry would be a Bitcoin dominated by Central Banks which try to influence development. I have nothing against Bitcoin being used as a part of a small strategic reserve of different nations, but if the dominance of these actors is too high, then a distortion of the check and balances system is possible. Again, if the community stays alert probably even Central Banks can't change Bitcoin's character, but if the community's character changes, then the pressure to remain in line with cypherpunk ideals could weaken eventually.","59":"My biggest worry would be a Bitcoin dominated by Central Banks which try to influence development.

I think that the biggest threats to bitcoin are not the central banks but the governments. Nowadays central banks are under governments' full control and do whatever the governments tell them. Even the CBDCs are introduced and are likely to be enforced by the governments and not the central banks. The original demand for CBDCs came from the governments who were afraid they would lose control over the population. so the governments demanded from the central banks to come with a something that would help them counter the spread of BTC as a way to make payment. Then the central banks came up with the idea of CBDCs which are pretty much the old bank (electronic) money under the disguise of crypto\/decentralized money (and in fact they are neither of these). So the governments want to keep the old fiat system that allows them to keep the people under full government control. Regarding BTC and other crypto money, the governments want to keep them as fully-transparent commodities that will be traded on exchanges for those who want to invest or play on the market. The recent regulations (AML5, AML6, MiCA, etc.) do everything possible to put crypto under strict government control, essentially defeating the purpose of the crypto as a payment method.","60":"I'm into crypto since 2013. Since the beginning I've always seen cryptos as an instrument of liberation from government slavery and the tiranny of central banks and an empowering tool for the poorest. Yes I'm glad BTC has become more valuable with time but I'm in firstly because I always intended it as an instrument to build a better world. Above green candles I'm more glad when I see an interview with a poor guy from africa using btc for micropayment or a pakistani woman using it to free herself from a system that would otherwise repress her. During all of these years I've been always skeptical about the different random guys shouting and putting themselves as great defender of btc from Peter McCormack, to bitcoinboy, from Tone Ways to any possible other person which acts as influencer. When there was the blocksize war I put myself in the middle between Roger Ver and Jimmy Song but with time I've built a maximalist portfolio mainly with btc. I also \"hodl\" eth and xmr. Now that btc has gone mainstream it looks to be the time to newer big players and cryptos have become only as a way to make money from BlackRock to Microstrategy. It looks everyone is forgiving where we are coming from. Not to mention people like trump who once called btc a scam. The old ideals and the utopia for a better future are becoming only a rich scheme. I've recently watched an interview with this new big idol Michael Saylor saying that 300k fee per transaction is ok and I'm losing my faith in btc. I fear we are going into a direction where one day (if not even now) we'll be hostage of these big players overtaking the community ideals despite any decentralization. These people are here to make money. They care zero about africans or privacy and they can dictate where the network has to go. These people are not with us. They are against us. We are not the same. What do you think about? Bitcoin's original ideals? Yes, they are slowly dying. Especially when centralization dominates the industry. Greedy corporations, banks, and governments are stockpiling BTC for their own benefit. They already dominate the market. Most people now consider BTC to be an investment tool than a currency (store of value). This is NOT what Satoshi wanted. Everything was supposed to be decentralized since day one. Yet, centralized exchanges have a large influence over market prices. With spot Bitcoin ETFs approved in the US and abroad, we've essentially introduced the traditional financial system into Bitcoin. Something that BTC was meant to avoid in the first place. Satoshi created BTC as a response against banks' inherent failures (economic crisis of 2008). Having them on-board, greatly defeats Bitcoin's intended purpose. At least, Bitcoin's open source nature gives us some level of hope. What's stopping someone from creating a truly-decentralized version of it in the future?","61":"I fear we are going into a direction where one day (if not even now) we'll be hostage of these big players overtaking the community ideals despite any decentralization.

What do you think about? Are you concern about Bitcoin in Africa or the west trying to centralized Bitcoin? I thought going mainstream was what everyone wanted, everyone loves to see Bitcoin going to $1m, do you think that money to print that value was going to come from retailers like you and I? Obviously no, it will have to come from institutional investors and they don't come to spray you any money, every billion they are spending today, they will make sure they make 10x of what is been invesed. Micheal Saylor is a business guy and has stood on business buying Bitcoin right from $12k and still buying even at $100k, you really expect him to say Bitcoin is for the poor? No, he will maximize the potential of Bitcoin as high as possible so that they can sell what is been invested in the future, that's there plan and that's what business is all about. I'm sorry but decentralization that I have seen many debate here is now history, people don't even care about that anymore, just the bag that's all.","62":"No content","63":"An interesting but short read https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YguVue0lgxM","64":"That is Peter Sheriff, a bitcoin critic.

It's clear that he's a good financial expert, but when it comes to bitcoin, he gets it all wrong. There's a statement in the comment section that says, \"If he had bought bitcoin just 5 years ago when the price was still below $10000, by now the profit would have given him enough money to buy as much metal as he wants and stock.

What a great day for Bitcoin! Wow I can't believe this day has finally come I just checked my phone thinking I wasn't going to see anything and boom this sucker is up to 103k! We're going beyond the moon shooting in to the stars now!!! Next huge milestone 200k","95":"It is truly incredible that Bitcoin has created a new ATH in just a few days in December, reaching $104k. This is really more than I expected. I had expected that Bitcoin might not be very bullish in December and it might be a bit difficult to reach six figures this month, but Bitcoin has managed to cross $100k and reach $104k in the beginning of December, which is much more than I expected. It is really fascinating to see my holding portfolio during such a pump. I have not been looking at Bitcoin charts for the last 2-3 days, suddenly today when I observed my portfolio, I was really surprised. Two things surprised me a lot, one is the price of Bitcoin and the second is the growth of the portfolio. Today I am doubly happy. Happy BTCitcoin $100k Day!","96":"Congrats, everyone!

People needed someone like Trump to take over, the market was in complete fear and after he won the confidence was back, are you seeing what I am seeing? If trump failed to win it is possible that this 100k will be slowed down, it will eventually happen but probably not this period of time. This is a big victory to all strong believers who held their Bitcoin all this time, congratulations.","99":"I know that threads about the price of bitcoin reaching $100k will be created in so many boards of the forum by different users but since we are in a happy mood that the price barrier of $100k has now been achieved, anyone can create thread about the excitement we are feeling right now. Just like magic, $100k was reached in less than 24 hours of consistent price pump. With this price movement of bitcoin, i can strongly believe that bitcoin can achieve any ATH at anytime now. I like the joy am feeling right now and i will want this joy not to end too soon if a massive correction do not happen because since a lot of investors has marked $100k as their selling target, no one knows what will happen after now but even if a price correction occurs, January will be another time to experience a great surge in the price.

Because I am quite happy that the price of Bitcoin has touched more and more, which has touched the all-time high of $104k. The more Bitcoin increases in price, the more it will create new records, and I am more confident that Bitcoin will reach the milestone of $200k in the future. However, even if it is not possible in this current season, it is most likely to be possible in the next 2025, because the impact of the 2025 bull run will be long-lasting, so of course the price of Bitcoin will be at its highest point at that time. So now we are just waiting for investment. Those who retired from Binance must have regretted it, because the price of Bitcoin will definitely go up further.","101":"Welcome to the price of Bitcoin touching $100k, but after a long time I was expecting this price of Bitcoin and it has been fulfilled.

Such scarcity is one of many reasons why Bitcoin has been believed to be a hedge against inflation. More classically, though, everybody trusts gold as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty that date back centuries. Growing institutional and retail confidence in Bitcoin after the election shows Bitcoin ETF inflows jumping to a record in the post election week to $2.6 billion. That said, the volatility in Bitcoin is a serious drawback to the stability in value that gold offers. Large reserves of gold are held by governments and central banks, while the movement of Bitcoin as a reserve asset is only just beginning. Of course, in the event that countries turn to Bitcoin for reserves, the higher price this could drive may benefit the holders but also make it very difficult for everyday transactions. But the possibility of Bitcoin ever wholly replacing gold is slim, more likely, it may complement gold as a strategic reserve asset, and experts stress its increasing yet not leading position.","125":"No content","126":"Warren Buffett is selling off stocks this year and hoarding USD.

Millions of individual Bitcoin\/crypto investors will need to liquidate their holdings if they lose their jobs, or are afraid of losing their jobs. If inflation spikes, then interest rates will also spike, which will diminish economic growth, leading to mass layoffs--and everything Trump has promised will inevitably spike inflation (it remains to be seen if he will really do any of this though). Is there a bull case for digital currencies during a US economic downturn though? What do you all think? Bitcoin is pretty much a toy for the rich, and Wall Street sees it as having the highest risk of all high risk investments. So in a sudden economic downturn the price would indubitably drop due to its eccentricity as an investment class. However, if economic problems are caused by a devaluing dollar, then we could actually see a \"flight to bitcoin\".","131":"If the recession happens then we'll be seeing massive bitcoin adoptors which definitely would lead to increments of bitcoin price Recall that bitcoin already is potential to store values during an economy downtime as that so I don't see bitcoin diminishing either does it have a potential set back of commodities and economy system. Bitcoin has potential and can be used as a store of value but I don't see it reaching that stage yet . I mean, with the current volatility , it's still not a perfect store of value and if we accept the reality , most people are just using it as a speculative asset. Remember the 2022 inflation period 1 year ago ? Bitcoin dumped when inflation peaked , showing it's not the store of value we once thought it was. Bitcoin is only used as an investment these days so a recession won't be good for it, I think bitcoin will get dumped if recession happens. The opposite could also happen if the new US administration turns it into a national reserve, but as we all know , Trump's idea is not easy to implement.","132":"Warren Buffett is selling off stocks this year and hoarding USD. Why? He clearly is expecting an economic downturn from Trump's tariffs and mass deportations. Americans have voted for massive changes to the US economy. Clearly the majority in the US feels these changes will be good for them. But Mr. Buffett clearly doesn't. Maybe he's right, or maybe he's wrong. We'll see. That is the thing, he could be right or wrong, we will never know what is going to happen, so he is betting on himself, so be it. The question is, if he's right, what will a recession do to the price of Bitcoin? We have seen it all, and yet Bitcoin holds it's own against this recession buy having it's bull run no matter what. My own assumption is that it will be very negative for the price. Millions of individual Bitcoin\/crypto investors will need to liquidate their holdings if they lose their jobs, or are afraid of losing their jobs.

Is there a bull case for digital currencies during a US economic downturn though? What do you all think? Just suck it in, right now we are in the bull run, till next year. But after that, in 2026, Bitcoin will have to rest and start all over again, meaning we will be in the bear market. So the price is going down, very hard, so most likely there will be investors who will shift to stocks and any other assets. But it doesn't mean that it will cause the downfall of the US economic other Trump, that's how Bitcoin works, we have a 4 year cycle.","133":"Buffett's stock sales this year, including huge sales of Apple and Bank of America, would appear more related to caution and grasping future opportunities rather than outright panic. Currently, he has loads of money in his pocket, which he could use when the prices go down during economic turmoil. Some have painted that as a warning sign of recession, but certainly not a promise of recession, it is complicated and associated with a number of factors that influence the markets. The impact of this recession on Bitcoin could happen in some very odd ways, of course, out of work people may liquidate a portion of their assets, including Bitcoin, which could drive down the price of the cryptocurrency in the coming months. However, Bitcoin is increasingly being framed as a hedge against inflation and a financial meltdown. If there is less confidence in traditional markets, demand for decentralized assets could grow. The relation between crypto and economic downturns isn't directly proportional, instead, it's an idea of safety during turmoil. This is to say that while moves from Buffett and economic shifts will not go unnoticed, Bitcoin might actually be resilient or thrive in the face of global sentiment and adoption trends.","134":"Warren Buffett is selling off stocks this year and hoarding USD. Why? He clearly is expecting an economic downturn from Trump's tariffs and mass deportations. Americans have voted for massive changes to the US economy. Clearly the majority in the US feels these changes will be good for them. But Mr. Buffett clearly doesn't. For an average American citizen, massive deportations will be good in terms that they'll have higher pay rate, better working conditions and more available jobs because migrants work like slaves but at the same time, there is a high chance that their deportation will increase the price on everything, so maybe the life of an average American citizen won't change for better but it's debatable. My own assumption is that it will be very negative for the price.

That's true, if millions of people lose their jobs, they'll be forced to sell their Bitcoin and altcoins because they need to eat something and if they don't have cash, then they need to convert their assets. Btw during bull run, even if you lose job, it's still hard to sell coins when you see how your asset's value increases. I think that whales will play a major role in Bitcoin's price again because from my understanding, average person would live a poor style instead of selling an asset that they see how it grows every day.","135":"For an average American citizen, massive deportations will be good in terms that they'll have higher pay rate, [...] It will only help your pay rate if you work in very specific industries, doing very specific things, like lower-end construction workers. Construction companies, as a whole, will do much worse since they will have to drastically raise prices, which will reduce demand, meaning they will sell fewer new homes. And fewer new homes means less sales of all kind of other goods that come with new home formation, etc. etc. And immigrant labor in the US also deeply affects the food industry, so grocery store prices will rise, and the hospitality industry, so restaurants and hotels will rise in price, which will affect the travel industry. In the longer run, the US will be a less friendly place to do business since our labor costs will be much higher. In short, like any government protectionism movement, this will be a positive thing for a small number of workers for a short period of time, but it will hurt everybody else immediately and weaken our economy in the long run. Quote That's true, if millions of people lose their jobs, they'll be forced to sell their Bitcoin and altcoins because they need to eat something and if they don't have cash, then they need to convert their assets. Btw during bull run, even if you lose job, it's still hard to sell coins when you see how your asset's value increases. I think that whales will play a major role in Bitcoin's price again because from my understanding, average person would live a poor style instead of selling an asset that they see how it grows every day. Um, the whales will get out long before ordinary people do . Unlike ordinary people, they have a staff of economists to help them time the market.","136":"If Trump choose to deport immigrants, America is no longer America that people know. I've heard something like this, if non Europe live in Europe, you're an immigrant, but if non American live in America, you're an American. Is there a bull case for digital currencies during a US economic downturn though? What do you all think? The crisis happened in 2007-2009 and 2019-2020, in early days, there's no way to know if US recession affect Bitcoin price, but in 2019-2020, corona virus did affect Bitcoin price, but it was happened not in bull run season, if covid happened in 2021, we can draw the conclusion.","137":"If Trump choose to deport immigrants, America is no longer America that people know. As far as I know, Trump never claimed that he will get rid off immigrants, and instead illegal immigrants and there's a huge difference between those two. I've heard something like this, if non Europe live in Europe, you're an immigrant, but if non American live in America, you're an American. Never heard that one, but big difference between Europe and US is that if for example you are born in Europe by illegal immigrant parents, you don't automatically get citizenship (many never get it), while in US you will automatically get it once you are born there.","138":"Warren Buffett is selling off stocks this year and hoarding USD.

Am happy Trump won to begin with and if it is going to affect the prices of things or cause a recession, it remains to be seen. The Russia- Ukraine war and the Israel -Hamas war ceased upon his winning and that's a good sign that shows that the economy may get better with time. There's of course a bull run for cryptocurrencies because Trump's son also has a coin he is to launch with the support of his repentant father who now has renewed hope for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.","139":"Well, that\u2019s how Warren Buffet point of view about having US recession and for me, everyone\u2019s point of view is reasonable. But I believe seeing bitcoin\u2019s high volatility, one thing is certain, bitcoin will definitely undergo price fluctuations based on its macroeconomic conditions or let\u2019s say even the condition of the asset itself. It could go on an upward or downward position, but rest assured the effect will only be temporary.","140":"Quote My own assumption is that it will be very negative for the price.

The opposite might happen seeing Bitcoin as their source of income. People losing jobs may redirect them to trading, and get more engaged with Bitcoin activities. Rich people might find Bitcoin as safe haven for their declining US dollar purchasing power and might put their funds into Bitcoin just to preserve their wealth. Since the dollar purchasing power is declining, Bitcoin price might reach its new height since it will become more expensive as the dollars weaken.","141":"In my opinion, you have formulated a very important question. It is very difficult to give a clear answer to this question. If the US recession is in 2025, when exactly will it start? In the middle of the year? Somewhere in May 2025? What will the price of Bitcoin be at that time? There are still six months until May 2025. During this time, the price of Bitcoin can double. From these levels, there can theoretically be a correction. At the same time, we cannot clearly answer whether a recession in the US will lead to an increase in the price of Bitcoin or to its fall. A recession in the US will definitely lead to a fall in oil prices and an economic catastrophe in countries such as Russia and other peripheral countries. The US will most likely suffer less than others. At the same time, the price of Bitcoin, as a rule, has an inverse correlation with the price of oil. Therefore, in the medium term, it may even grow (although short-term panic falls in the price of the first cryptocurrency are also possible).","142":"He is often right, but whatever he chooses to do is his choice. It was said he had already cashed out his stock holdings, but I don't think he has piles of cash at home or in his home vault. For someone who has been making money in trading, I think he already is into Bitcoin he can't just make it public. A rich guy like him would probably fly somewhere else if the recession comes, maybe he would turn his money to gold or invest in China stocks.","143":"Warren is fearful when others are greedy, and he is greedy when others are fearful. Simple as that. Warren's just following his old philosophy when many are still euphoric after Trump's winner in US election, then he took advantage to sell his asset at peak. As for the recession impact to the Bitcoin, the recession will cause bitcoin's price to slip. It's obvious. I meant, during a recession, people will do anything for money. The best way is to sell bitcoin, their most liquid asset. It took a few seconds to exchange your bitcoin to cash.","144":"It's not a speculation anymore though, US has been experiencing recession for a couple of years now and in that duration we saw that it creates sell pressure on bitcoin preventing its rise. But that was not just US in recession, but most of the world was also in recession which meant the sell pressure was global and it caused the drops which is why bitcoin is still below $100k after all this time. In the future, more recession which they only would battle by increasing interest rates in the US, would similarly cause sell pressure and can affect the bull run. The only two other things to consider are: 1) Will it be global? In your arguments, the recession is in US only and as long as it remains that way the impact on bitcoin is not going to be as big as it was before. 2) Will there be inflation as well? All the deportation (firing bulk of US workforce) and the tariff war would create much higher inflation compared to the past couple of years in the US. We already know inflation positively affects bitcoin by increasing its price. On top of that we have dedollarisation going on and with Trump and his wars against their world (specially now that we have seen some of his cabinet members who are the biggest warmongers in America) we can be sure that dedollarisation will speed up which can lead to US dollar tanking hard. Obviously that means bitcoin price shooting up automatically.","145":"Warren's just following his old philosophy when many are still euphoric after Trump's winner in US election, then he took advantage to sell his asset at peak. Honestly, now is the wrong time to buy Bitcoin. Anyone who is buying now should've bought a month ago. Although, if you are looking to sell off some of your holdings to get some cash, now is a good time. I just sold about $500 worth of BTC. Zero regrets whatsoever. (And I still have a huge stash.)","146":"No content","147":"The markets have spoken, and it would appear that they don't seem to rate Trump's victory as being all that significant for Bitcoin.

Although there are tiny numbers of people (e.g. certain crypto businesses and brokers) that have been negatively effected by current US policy, the market overall for Bitcoin is essentially 100% free and open to any investor who wants to bet on Bitcoin here. 2. It's clear that US laws won't significantly change under Trump in a way that will pump Bitcoin's price. Bitcoin is 100% legal in the US and anybody here who wants to can buy and sell it. Hence the only imaginable new laws would have to involve forcing people to buy Bitcoin, which is very unlikely under Trump or any other US president (forcing people to buy Trump's coin, on the other hand, might be something he will try to do ). 3. Trump's policies involve a lot of new risk to the US economy. Trump has promised two gigantic changes to the US economy: massive import tariffs that will trigger a worldwide trade war, and the deportation of 20 million US residents, millions of whom work in key labor markets.

Bitcoin is not $200 today, it's not easy to pump such a huge price with that percentage. It's 100% clear that Trump's victory had a positive impact on the price but the real positive impact will come when he comes in governance and does the actual job.

The actual dictionary definition of \"legal tender\" is a law that requires that all citizens accept the currency as a form of payment whether they want to or not. Bitcoin is 100% legal in the USA to buy, hold and sell. There is no way for it to get \"legaler\". The only thing the US government could possibly do not to increase the price would be to force US citizens to buy it, either as individuals, or through their tax dollars when the government buys Bitcoin.

Trump's policies involve a lot of new risk to the US economy. Trump has promised two gigantic changes to the US economy: massive import tariffs that will trigger a worldwide trade war, The bigger risk is more isolation of United States! This time US is not going to run a tariff war alone, they are forcing others to do it as well specially Europeans (that are more like slaves than allies for US). But can others follow?

In my opinion the current US election climate is more nuanced and not quite an endorsement for stability. The market reactions this far tend to be indicative that the policy posture of Trump, with a possibility for laying trade tariffs and immigration reform, might further sustain inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. For this, investors may take notice and change positions both in traditional assets and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In light of the key position taken by Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, these actions could actually increase its demand. Contrary to the assumption that a Trump win would hold no weight of great importance to Bitcoin. Historically, elections add a layer of volatility and may influence a shift in sentiment. That had been the case in the previous years, when both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin tended to be up after elections. A win by Trump could be a replay of the post-election rally of 2016, propelled by business-friendly policies. However, extended turmoil or uncertainty over his policies would keep Bitcoin more volatile. While Bitcoin has remained accessible, therefore, any economic policy change in the United States, whoever the president might be, is still likely to continue its influence on investor psychology within the given sector.","162":"2.

If I'm not mistaken, there are 91 criminal cases against him. In the entire history of America, there has never been a president who had such a set of cases. So who are all these people who elected a criminal to head the state? Oh, it seems to me that they are exactly the same.

Do we have the right to do so and what guarantees that if we had a lot of money and were in their shoes, we would never be like them? I'm not saying that government holding a majority of bitcoin is a good thing but it's not necessarily a bad thing either because everything has its pros and cons. I think it's better to find ways to adapt to survive than to complain about things we can't change.","164":"1. Bitcoin has been doing just fine under Biden, going up 500% while he was president. Although there are tiny numbers of people (e.g. certain crypto businesses and brokers) that have been negatively effected by current US policy, the market overall for Bitcoin is essentially 100% free and open to any investor who wants to bet on Bitcoin here. He was elected when we are about to start the bull run, so it make sense that the price will have to pump. Of course, market is free, but it will be good and open wide if he was very friendly to it. However, they have a hard line stance specially in the last 2 years. And I would assume that you have heard about, Operation Choke Point 2.0: How U.S. Regulators Fight Bitcoin With Financial Censorship 2. It's clear that US laws won't significantly change under Trump in a way that will pump Bitcoin's price. Bitcoin is 100% legal in the US and anybody here who wants to can buy and sell it. Hence the only imaginable new laws would have to involve forcing people to buy Bitcoin, which is very unlikely under Trump or any other US president (forcing people to buy Trump's coin, on the other hand, might be something he will try to do ). But you have to admit though that the price did pump after Trump winning the Presidency. I will agree though that his government will not force the Americans to buy Bitcoin or crypto. That is not the point of being crypto friendly, the point is that somewhat Bitcoiners can freely buy in any crypto exchanges. 3. Trump's policies involve a lot of new risk to the US economy. Trump has promised two gigantic changes to the US economy: massive import tariffs that will trigger a worldwide trade war, and the deportation of 20 million US residents, millions of whom work in key labor markets. Although it remains to be seen if Trump will actually implement these promises (the markets right now are betting he won't), this certainly adds risk that was not there under Biden. Every administration has his own policy, and it's very controversial changes in the US economy. But let's see how it goes for him. There is already risk as the US is still trying to recover and every country for that matter. But as President, he will do anything in his power to chance the US.","165":"Although US government and its decisions affect bitcoin price but the market never depended on US and that is not about to change. I agree because Bitcoin market is globally, not nationally in a single country. But big countries like China, USA and their policy changes can have impacts on Bitcoin market and price. People on the market will react naturally to policy changes in these big countries and it won't change in future too. In long term Bitcoin will grow more with many more new presidents in USA and their different policies on this market, but Bitcoin is unstoppable in my opinion. Quote Bitcoin first went to $74k back in March 2024. And we tested $70k+ multiple times over the past couple of months (at least 6 times), last time was before US election on October 29. The current rise is nothing new either even though it's an ATH and could even lead to much bigger rises because the resistance is broken not because some convicted felon became US president! Accumulation phase finished and resistance must be broken for Bitcoin to break out. 8 months for accumulation phase is like enough, and Bitcoin only waits for a big news for example in this case the new President in the USA, and it's good that he said that he will support Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market. Without Trump, Bitcoin will have other reasons to break out, so this break out days ago was not only because of Trump.","166":"I'm not saying that government holding a majority of bitcoin is a good thing but it's not necessarily a bad thing either because everything has its pros and cons. I think it's better to find ways to adapt to survive than to complain about things we can't change. Unfortunately it's almost impossible if you want to prevent government to acquire and hold Bitcoin You must trade Bitcoin with people who're not related to government, trade via online make us never know who're the one we trade, however trading via face to face not necessary mean we're not trade with people who work in officials. So, it's not possible to adapt to survive, but if we trade our coins through DEX or No KYC P2P, it decrease the chance our coins will belong to them, since the government mostly use CEX specifically Coinbase.","167":"No content","168":"This subject is very important for me, for multiple reasons. I think it worries many bitcoiners that, the fact that we have full custody of our hard money, makes it difficult to develop a good inheritance plan. Searching through the forum, I 've seen many topics around this subject (like this), but my purpose is to share some plans and (perhaps) construct a solid one together. Plan A: 1. Construct a multi-signature wallet, that consists of 2 cosigners (2-of-2). 2. Back up the 2 cosigners twice each. So you will have A1, A2, B1, B2, where A1 = A2 and B1 = B2. 3. Store all the backups in 4 separate locations. 4. Hold A1 yourself and give B1 to your inheritors. A2 and B2 will be stored in very safe places that you will determine. A1 and A2 will be known to you only. B2 will be known to the inheritors. So they will know where B1 and B2 backups are. 5. In your will, you will give them the locations of A1, A2 and specific instructions on how to recover the wallet using one of the A1, A2 and one of the B1, B2. Obviously you can let them know about your plan and teach them what they will need to do beforehand. So in your will you need to specify the locations only. But a recovery plan written in the will is not redundant in my opinion. Advantages: 1. Only you have access to the wallet during your lifetime, because the locations A1, A2 are not known. 2. The inheritors have B1 and B2, which means that they will need to \"lose\" both of them to lose access to the wallet. 3. The lawyers know where A1, A2 are stored, but even if they gained access to them, they can't do anything because they are ignorant about B1, B2. Disadvantages: 1. Kind of hard for the inheritors? Perhaps... 2. If the lawyer loses your will, then both locations A1 and A2 become unknown, so the wallet is non recoverable. To mitigate this, you can use 2 lawyers, one holding A1's location and one holding A2's location. Plan B: 1. Generate a wallet (simple single-sig) and give it to your children. Also keep a backup somewhere safe (the children can know about it). 2. Create a locktime transaction, setting the locktime to be X years from now. The receiving address will be one address from the wallet in step (1). 3. Give the locktime transaction to your heirs, but also keep some backups in some places. 4. When the time passes, the children can receive the funds. Advantages: 1. Very easy. One broadcast and everything is good. Disadvantages: 1. The fee needs to be planned ahead. Of course the children can use CPFP later, but this adds a little complexity. 2. The years are limiting. You can update the locktime transaction of course, but you will need to update your whole setup again. May cause confusion to the inheritors. Please, share your ideas below and add your plans so we can have a discussion about them. More\/New ideas: Any good plan that is shared in this discussion, I will add it to this post.","169":"I simple shared my seed with a trusted family member. He knows how to recover it or how to research about it. I know some people has trust issues with their family. I think that if you lack trust every setup will be complicated. The first idea of your plan is pretty good, but I don't like to get lawyers involved. I think bitcoin works better just p2p in this situation","170":"I am a student and I do not have an inheritance to give yet, but that does not prevent me from giving my opinion. I am leaning towards plan A, but I think that a few elements should be added to make it even more solid. The idea of building a multi-signature wallet is really good for ensuring security, but it would also be important to train the heirs so that they know how to manage these assets. In addition, having clear documentation on the steps to follow and the locations of the backups could really help avoid confusion. For example, we can establish a document that explains how to access the backups and how to use the keys to recover the wallet, while showing them how to do it step by step. This would ensure that, even if something happens, the heirs can easily access all of this. Basically, plan A is solid, but good communication and preparation of the heirs are essential for a successful transition. I appreciate you taking the time to comment on the subject, but I 've already made these comments myself in the OP. 4. Hold A1 yourself and give B1 to your inheritors. A2 and B2 will be stored in very safe places that you will determine. A1 and A2 will be known to you only. B2 will be known to the inheritors. So they will know where B1 and B2 backups are. 5.

Seriously I don\u2019t think any of the idea above is actually bad, one thing that many people are scare of are actually trusting their kin but i say no matter how you actually take this away from them the inheritance will fall to them, so rather than giving out too much information to an outsider it is better to find kin to trust and then use the plan B so you or them don\u2019t spend it sooner or later. What I will do is probably use the two idea, timelock the funds and would definitely be spending it to a multi sig wallet, give the other recovery seed to the lawyer to give out in the day of will reading and back the Same seed up at a bank deposit, the both shouldn\u2019t necessarily get lost, the other co-signer seed will be give to my Kin with him having to know the location of also another to backup of it too. I feel it might have its own flaws but we cannot simply defeats all the flaws in settings like this","172":"I would like to create a single signature wallet as gift to my children and honestly, I don't know when I pass away so I will not choose a complicated method as your first one. Making complicated inheritance planning is like using a complicated backup method that in the end can cause a loss. Backup in my opinion, need to be simple, so as inheritance plan for your children. I would like let my wife, husband knows about it too, just in case I sudden pass away, my partner will know about that inheritance plan, how to recover a wallet, and can do on behalf of me for my children.","173":"I read through your OP kinda quickly so forgive me if I glossed over this but one of the most important things when it comes to inheritance planning is one of the most simplistic things and that is making sure that you've got a will established. This is not even something that requires a lawyer to set up (such as a trust) and is one of the most pivotal l aspects of any financial plan\/portfolio. So make sure to get those will's established!","174":"It's simple at least for me, is not hard for me, just like others have said, inheritance doesn't need to be too technical, because for a life well leaved and accompanied with a successful Bitcoin journey as an alternative, passing on to whoever comes after me is not to be a big deal for me, since I have a daughter whom I have groomed with the knowledge about Bitcoin and she have access to all my financial details. I think it is better to educate those who inherites our hard work Bitcoin since not educating them could lead to mismanagement of the inherited wealth and a waste of my life long hard work. I don't keep my secret keys to myself and infact, my spouse have my keys and also my daughter, those are the most trusted people around me and I will like them to have my bitcoin when I am no more.","175":"I would like to create a single signature wallet as gift to my children and honestly, I don't know when I pass away so I will not choose a complicated method as your first one.

I don't keep my secret keys to myself and infact, my spouse have my keys and also my daughter, those are the most trusted people around me and I will like them to have my bitcoin when I am no more. It might be easier for married Bitcoiners to have an inheritance plan. You can easily teach your spouse how to recover a wallet and other Bitcoin transaction processes. For people who are single and want to give their Bitcoin to their parents, it is a big problem. Most of the elderly don't have an interest in Bitcoin. So we would have to make recovering and accessing a wallet easy. Another problem with unmarried people is the issue of trust. Telling a sibling or relative that you have bitcoin might be risky. These days people do anything for money.","176":"Sometimes, as the year proceeds we usually notice that there is someone in the family who we can confide so much on and if there's someone like that, you can entrust them with your Bitcoin, you don't have to tell them what it is but what they must only know is that the item you are handing over them should be given to the person you desire, after your departure. By then, if you want your kids to have access to the Bitcoin, you must have educated them about Bitcoin so that after you must have passed on, when they receive the package, they would know what to do to access the fund.","177":"~ \"Cryptoassets Inheritance Planing\" (by Pamela Morgan) is the good reading that could help your planning. It stresses that beside aspects relevant to technical details the inheritance plan should contain some legal part. \"Cryptoassets will become part of your legal estate in most jurisdictions, and will be subject to local laws and taxes, whether or not you want them to be. This is the reality of our current jurisdiction-dependent judicial system. Your access plan alone won\u2019t be enough to ensure your assets are passed to your chosen beneficiaries. Without a legal plan, the default laws of your jurisdiction will usually apply. In the next section, we\u2019ll look at these default laws and ways to ensure you get to decide who gets what. We\u2019ll also talk about taxes, what really happens in estates, and how to avoid the most common mistakes people make in estate planning.\" Will you do something in this direction to make legal the crypto-heritage for your legatees? Regarding my plan: In my case, the relevant flash drives, PIN to HW pgp keys and detailed instruction will be handed over to heir by me in person, while he will get the envelope with those physical pgp keys from representatives of the legal service I have contracted with. More about all of those stuff (like HW pgp keys, PINs to them etc) is here. Flash drives are not mandatory, The transferred media may be in the form of SD card. My last purchase is Samsung Pro Endurance microSD (huge lifetime).","178":"The major issue here is trust, because if there is trust in the family, there will be no complicated process of hiding our person information about bitcoin from our spouses or children only to be revealed to them when we are no more alive. Just like @Odusko has rightly said, these same people we are hodling these investments for might end up mismanaging the investment or become too careless to disclose some information to scammers which might lead them to losing everything you worked for in one day. All these will arise because they were not educated by the right person on what to do and what not to do with all the information about bitcoin. As a person with the intention of transferring my wealth to another person, I already know who I want to take over from me. I will make sure that person knows all I know about bitcoin so recoverying them when I'm no more will not be complicated.

Though not as volatile as shitcoin, it is quite volatile and could temporary fall below buying price.","204":"Nope, as long as you know what you're doing then no such thing happens.

What happened to \"HODL\"? If you keep that in your mind and heart, you won\u2019t make mistakes when it comes to investing-or not investing. Bitcoin is the only solid investment in the crypto world, so no matter what negative news or bad speculations come up, that\u2019s just from people who lack knowledge and can\u2019t trust it.

That is in essence, what are some recurring hiccups, that could hinder a successful Bitcoin investment plan? Being impatient. That's it! Most of the new investors think that the long term investors didn't do anything, well, technically that's right but along with that long wait is about being patient naturally. Without that attitude in investing in Bitcoin, you're likely not going to reach that point of success because you can possibly sell at losses and be in panic.","207":"Based on my experience, being too confident and forgetting to set up a stop-loss even if you plan to invest for the long term can be a problem too. Then again I believe it depends on what you define as \"initial stage\". In the past failing to set up a proper stop-loss (either too early or too late) makes me miss a good opportunity to sell some of my investment. On the other hand, setting it way too early (being weak hands, as mentioned above) costs me a good opportunity to acquire more sats. I believe there's no harm in selling some of your investment if it gives you profit already, assuming you don't sell all of them. I believe there's a detailed guide on how to calculate how much you could sell in the past.","208":"probably hastily investing when the price is already too high, the only thing holding you back from getting profit earlier is the average price of your investment that's too high. some newbie like to be in hurry, investing as if there's no tomorrow and settle with unfavorable price, since BTC price swings anyway, why don't anyone just wait it out until it dipped at some point and buy at discounted price. also, being weak hand, as many other people pointed, could spell you to your doom, because you will sell at really unfavorable price, likely trying cutting loss but instead dumped your entire bag at the lowest price ever.","209":"Are there any recurrent hiccups that can happen at the initial stage, that needs to be noted, when an investor just begins investing in Bitcoin and also when he\/she is trying to replicate a previous bitcoin investment strategy for good returns? That is in essence, what are some recurring hiccups, that could hinder a successful Bitcoin investment plan? Before investors start investing in Bitcoin, they need to first understand the investment risks involved because there are many obstacles faced by investors who are just starting to invest. Investors should avoid using third-party services to store their assets because the potential for asset loss is very large, such as theft or the Exchange suddenly going bankrupt, of course the assets will simply disappear. Investors should always make rational decisions when starting to invest, avoiding FOMO is something that needs to be done to prevent things that can hinder investment plans.","210":"-snip- I believe there's no harm in selling some of your investment if it gives you profit already, assuming you don't sell all of them. I believe there's a detailed guide on how to calculate how much you could sell in the past. Because the main purpose of investment is profit, there is nothing wrong with selling part of the investment for the profit that needs to be taken. But sometimes there are people who are too confident by not wanting to take a penny of the price they get when the price has shown the target price they want to achieve. They expect too high and when the price starts to fall and continues to be followed by a prolonged bear market, there will only be regrets, why not sell some and then buy below. Setting how much to take profit is also needed, I will also take some profits when the price exceeds my main target, and surely the profit can be a reserve fund to prepare to buy on the next decline. But it all depends on how each person's strategy is, some continue to survive and forget their investment for years and when they start to open their investments, huge profits are obtained perfectly, but also the opposite happens.","211":"Nope, as long as you know what you're doing then no such thing happens.

Those people who aren't well aware about Bitcoin or lack technical knowledge to protect their Bitcoin and other crypto assets might have those hiccups but not everyone. You're exaggerating, aren't you? You \"never\" experienced \"any kind of fear or hiccups\"? In all your years with Bitcoin? I'm not sure, but you're probably either forgetting or lying. In the first place, fear comes with unfamiliarity and we were all newbies once. You trade daily to weekly and you experienced not a single hiccup? Come on!","212":"Before I invest in Bitcoin, what I need to know and learn is that Bitcoin is a very profitable long-term investment and also without any obstacles as long as it is intended for the long term and forget and ignore negative news that affects the price of Bitcoin. Because whatever happens in the end the price of Bitcoin will recover or rise again. So so far I have not felt any obstacles because I have instilled the belief that in the future Bitcoin will give me great benefits, and make Bitcoin my routine to always set aside a small portion of my money to buy Bitcoin and consider it as something ordinary. And maybe for people who are new to investing in Bitcoin, they will definitely experience obstacles or obstacles, especially for those who do not have experience and knowledge in Bitcoin. Especially they do not know the traces and negative or positive things that affect the price of Bitcoin, which indeed these things will definitely repeat or happen, but in the end it will go up again. And this is what they have to think about that Bitcoin is a good long-term investment.","213":"If you want no 'hiccups' here is what you need to do: 1. Buy bitcoin. 2. Hold. Forget about the price. 3. Don't sell for another 10 years. Wash, rinse, repeat (DCA).

That is in essence, what are some recurring hiccups, that could hinder a successful Bitcoin investment plan? Getting too affected by FOMO or FUD. This happens a lot with new investors. They are either too scared or too eager. They buy when they see the market going up because of FOMO and even though I know bitcoin will still continue to rise, it is important that you buy it at the cheapest price possible not the most expensive to obtain maximum profit. At the same time, you also shouldn\u2019t be swayed by short term or temporary dips or negative news and immediately sell your funds. Remain levelheaded and objective at all times.","215":"Are there any recurrent hiccups that can happen at the initial stage, that needs to be noted, when an investor just begins investing in Bitcoin and also when he\/she is trying to replicate a previous bitcoin investment strategy for good returns? That is in essence, what are some recurring hiccups, that could hinder a successful Bitcoin investment plan? I have not been in the Bitcoin space for a long time to complete the four-year cycle. But from my observation, FUD is one of the major challenges people go through. I observed that there are individuals and organisations whose main task is to cause and promote FUD, and this will cause many weak hands to dump their coins. Another issue might be uncertainties. Some investors have good plans but they don't give room for emergencies. There could be health issues, loss of job, natural disasters and so on; without emergency funds, Bitcoin investment plans might be truncated. Keeping your Bitcoin in a centralized platform. I am sure people who kept their money in FTX had great plans. But that single mistake of not keeping it in a decentralized wallet has affected their plans.","216":"That is in essence, what are some recurring hiccups, that could hinder a successful Bitcoin investment plan? First the major hiccup occurances that Bitcoin investors may encounter is \"fluctuations\" of volume prices at when the price of Bitcoin depreciates when investors were expecting market increase during holding to make profits. Then it may push Investors to quick selling of their assets due to FOMO then, their investment plans must have negatively been affected their goal of holding until they makes profits. Another is investors with the DCAs accumulation plans. Understanding the strategies of the DCAs, investors are either scheduled on buying their Bitcoin assets bite by bits maybe because they don't have the exact fund to purchase and accumulate up to the expected value of Bitcoin to their assets at a time, and same lane, they ought to place purchasing orders when the market price is depreciating to buy higher values with minimum amount but due to the highily volatile of the market, price may suddenly increase which becomes disruption to their accumulation plans. Although this sensational investment effects remains effective on \"weak hearted\" volatile investors who can not stand the storms in the fluctuating crypto markets. I tagged this reoccurrence effects on \"price fluctuations\" because the volatility of Bitcoin potentials can not be manipulated by investors so, failure to bear that fact would keep investors investment plans reoccurring from achieving a successful investment plans.","217":"Not knowing when to enter the market is one big challenge any newbie could face as a recurrent investment hiccups that though in my opinion I perceive as a necessary evil for them to understand that bitcoin is a volatile asset and timing it when to jump into the market is key to staying in profit more often. The result you get entering the market when it's in dip is obviously different from when the market is experiencing a correction. Something just a small section of newbie are acquainted with.","218":"Are there any recurrent hiccups that can happen at the initial stage, that needs to be noted, when an investor just begins investing in Bitcoin and also when he\/she is trying to replicate a previous bitcoin investment strategy for good returns? That is in essence, what are some recurring hiccups, that could hinder a successful Bitcoin investment plan? if you start investing with the right mindset and strategy and continue with that, you wouldn't face any challenges but if you start with the wrong mindset and a wrong investment strategy, you're certainly going to meet hindrances along the way which will prevent you from effective investment. The wrong mindset is mostly that you're hoping to get quick profit and it leads you to use an amount you're not willing to leave in Bitcoin for a long period of time, once that's the case, every bull will become a distraction to sell and every DIP will want to propel you to still sell. DCA solves this challenge and gives you calmness throughout all the period you're investing in Bitcoin because you know you're not investing too much at a time and while you continue to buy you get used to volatility and wouldn't always become worried of what will become of Bitcoin or your invested money.","219":"The \"hiccups\" are going to be mostly you acting on your emotions \u2014 panic selling due to fud, going all in, or buying on leverage because of greed, those stuff. There should be little to no \"hiccups\" if you're just dollar-cost averaging and buying spot.","220":"The excitement will be a failure at the first volatility that an inexperienced investor sees. We see these panic sales, and we see the accusation that the price has fallen and people are forced to sell to save the funds that are left. And until a person sees his mistakes after recovery and further growth, he will not be able to truly test everything on his own experience. No matter how much is written that investing should involve strong hands and faith, you can also often see accusations from those who are impatient or too hasty.","221":"No content","222":"I pledge 20 BTC for whoever submit the funniest bitcoin image with the word \"Bitcoin GALORE!\" by the end of November.

Throughout history, money has taken many forms, but money consistently serves three functional purposes: a store of value, a unit of account, and a medium of exchange. Who has led you people to believe money cannot be an asset? Is it because the value of fiat currencies never appreciate anymore? because they just depreciate? A currency can also be an asset. Gold for example is a currency and it's also an asset. If you hold dollars, pounds, yuan or euros to appreciate so you can sell and make a profit from it then you have made those fiat currencies an asset. It's the same with bitcoin. It's an asset and also a currency. It is mostly used as an asset doesn't mean it is no longer a currency. They are not mutually exclusive, it can be a currency\/money and also an asset.

I wasn't keen on joining the other discussion over there before now, as the op literally is a shit poster, a hater and someone who doesn't understand what he speaks of... What I think will be best to describe Bitcoin is just very simply as a digital asset. It's not something that can be held or seen but then it retains its value in the physical form.Bitcoin also exhibits characteristics of both money and assets I just wonder why some people keeps making things complicated for them selfs. What distinguish BTC from all other currency or digital asset is that it is decentralized, it isn't controlled by any person or owned by any country. Thats the first fun fact making it an even better asset and form of money. Now, to be considered as money, it should be able to facilitate transactions, and have a standard unit of value.. Bitcoin meets these criteria, serving as a medium of exchange, with its own pricing mechanism and ability to store and retrieve value, despite volatility...as a digital asset, Bitcoin represents unique digital ownership, offering potential value appreciation over time. Again, its total supply is capped at 21 million, giving it the last attribute, scarcity I'm not the type that likes writing a wall of text but I just tried to see how I can use my common knowledge to explain why BTC is both a digital asset, a better form of money, and why it was created as an alternative payments method. Its value changes due to market factors, making it akin to an asset like gold or stocks, which also fluctuate in value.","252":"In my opinion all cryptocurrencies are assets.

Bitcoin is also called future money because the algorithm it runs on can be used like fiat money in the future because of the amount of inflation that occurs in fiat money people are slowly losing faith in fiat money and the land gold and the digital asset bitcoin are in abundance. being attracted so Bitcoin can definitely be called an asset.

Crypto is centrally controlled and created to generate quick profits for its creators or early investors. It relies on strong marketing of lies, deception, and fraud; Please don't get confused. In terminology, cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptography for security.[1] You can read more about cryptocurrency below[1] and Bitcoin is part of these so called cryptocurrency meaning Bitcoin is under the umbrella of cryptocurrency. Even if you believe that crypto is not Bitcoin (which is wrong) but altcoin, they still have in common. They both runs in blockchain, the difference is that some are running in centralized blockchain and others are in decentralized blockchain. Both can be transferred and use as either currency or asset depends on the belief of the holder. And both uses cryptography to secure its network. Given the things they have in common, it is obvious altcoin and Bitcoin falls under one umbrella the cryptocurrency. Quote crypto is like fiat money, where a small group of people controls monetary policy. Another thing, other than CBDC (if this is considered a cryptocurrency) cryptocurrency can't be like fiat money in terms of issue since fiat money are issued by the government while Cryptocurrencies are not. Quote Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a far superior form of money without a central leader or group of leaders. Its users do not have to trust anyone, making it truly peer-to-peer and resistant to censorship or control. Bitcoin may be superior in terms of security but I do not think Bitcoin outperforms fiat digital transfers. They both have advantages and disadvantage so I think whether Bitcoin is a superior form of money is debatable. Certain issues like scaling, time confirmation, volatility, and use case is attached to Bitcoin so I think we cannot fully say that Bitcoin is far superior form of money.

Real estate can't be regenerated by nature. Can the nature increase the size of the earth? No, that isn't a possibility. Other assets such as metals and precious minerals, can have an unknown supply, of course, no human being can determine how much oil or gold exists in the whole world and whether or not more of its supply can come into circulation in the future because more can be found. Oil is a different thing as well because it's consumed and it vanishes after that. Talking about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, if we say that Bitcoin is an asset because it has value and can be used to carry out transactions then I would say it's arguable that all cryptocurrencies that exist in the market right now are assets because they all can be used to carry out transactions and they all have a value, for the time being. It can be said that it depends on each person's needs and each person will use it in different circumstances. Bitcoin was created for everyone and everyone has the right to use bitcoin for their own purposes, don't feel bad just because someone doesn't think like you or their purpose of using bitcoin is different from yours. I agree with this. Nothing else really matters, it all depends on how one sees Bitcoin and what they use it for. Some might use it for online transactions, some for investment purposes, some to save their wealth, etc.","263":"No content","264":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount.

What I do is to take a chill pills relax and give the spammers time to have they days, in no time they will run out ability to keep the bitcoin network congested and by then the transaction fees and network traffic will revert back to normal again.","266":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? Yes of course, high transaction fee irritates everyone who is about to use the network at that time of congestion and that is why you see that most regular bitcoin users who are on small transactions will pause using bitcoin and use altcoins whose transaction fees are very cheap, until Bitcoin blockchain becomes free from attack. What I do is that I don't act as if I have bitcoin at that moment when the blockchain is congested so that I don't get frustrated with high transaction fees. I don't use LN because opening a channel is what I am not use to and I don't want to learn it for some personal reasons.","267":"For frequent transactions and small amount of bitcoin, use lightning network. You can make use of very low fee or $0 fee if you are using lightning network. There are many newbies friendly noncustodial bitcoin lightning network wallet now. Lists of open-source bitcoin lightning wallets Exchanges like Binance, OKX, BitMart, Bitfinix, Bisq, Robosats, Paxful, Kucoin Noones and some other exchanges are having lightning network for deposit and withdraw now. This will ease your frustration when bitcoin mempool is congested.","268":"For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Only people who are too careless will not do double check and realize that they will receive small leftover after a transaction, with too big transaction fee that is bigger than the value of transaction. Careful people will realize it by double check information when broadcasting a transaction and don't complete the transaction broadcast. Quote Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? It is irritating and I'd like to calm down, hold on my need for an on chain transaction. Delay it and wait for mempools to become clearer then give me better transaction fee rate to choose. Check mempools and choose good time to consolidate small inputs or make transactions.","269":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. This is the major reason for transaction fee spike. Without traffic you don't need to pay much to get your transaction on the priority list. High fees are a pain for anyone experiencing it when you need a transaction to be confirmed in good time, but it helps to prepare for it before a network congestion; \u2022 Consolidate your small inputs when transaction fees are low, \u2022 Use LN for micro transactions, \u2022 Use segwit and avoid multiple inputs as much as is possible.","270":"OP, by asking such a question, you should offer a solution like how to restore your nervous system. I think that all the topics you have created arise from your psychological state at the moment. And if you check the mempool today, then you have nothing to worry about. On the other hand, the person who understands why high commissions arise understands perfectly well and has a strong nervous system to worry in vain since everything is temporary. But if such a question is raised by you, OP, you need sedatives to create topics with a deeper meaning.","271":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? Nobody is comfortable paying high transaction fees because many embraced Bitcoin due to low transaction fees. I have learned not to be over-troubled by what I don't have control over. Periodic high transaction fees have come to stay until a solution is devised to stop the attack on the mempool. Instead of being irritated, it will be better to devise means of paying low fees. Consider consolidating your transactions if you have many deposits (UTXOs) when the transaction fees is down.","272":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? What question is this? no one likes high transaction fees on the bitcoin blockchain, especially if we want to make bitcoin transactions. Moreover this is a problem for adopters who do not have a lot of bitcoins, solutions already exist for this problem, you can use LN for small transactions, this will not be a problem for those who have a large bitcoin balance. If I had a lot of bitcoin, even 500 sat\/vB wouldn't irritate me either.","273":"I don't feel irritated by bitcoin insane fees when the network get feed with alot of spam transaction all in an attack against the bitcoin network, and the reason why I never feel irritated is because I already know that such attacks will come once in a while due to bitcoin network possibility of that ordina spams. What I do is to take a chill pills relax and give the spammers time to have they days, in no time they will run out ability to keep the bitcoin network congested and by then the transaction fees and network traffic will revert back to normal again. Have you ever thought what would happen if bitcoin became more popular? I mean the majority of people in the world will use bitcoin, and that will also cause the bitcoin network to become congested and transaction fees will remain high forever, not temporarily like now. Not to mention, spammers will not stop and you can also see that after BRC20 passes, we already have Rune, and I believe that in the future there will be something else to replace Rune to continue spamming the network. I don't believe anyone would feel comfortable wanting to move bitcoin, but high transaction fees have slowed things down. So we'd be fooling ourselves if we said we weren't upset when bitcoin fees skyrocketed.","274":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? I always dodge micro transactions using Bitcoin because the fee is not economical even if the network is not congested. I usually have altcoins such as stablecoins on a separated wallet that I use for micro payment or daily transaction use. I have no problem with Bitcoin network congested because I only use Bitcoin for long term investment purposes not for casual transactions but I get the point of being irritated if you really need the Bitcoin but the fee consumed significant amount of the balance.","275":"Annoyed, of course, and it made me have to pay more on the transactions I made. And it also depends on how much Bitcoin you want to send, if the amount is quite large or for example 1 BTC with a fee of about $10 it is still good enough and the important thing is that there is no traffic jam that is too severe. What is annoying is when transactions are very stuck due to the increase in the number of transactions that are usually caused by Ordinal, BRC20 or Rune so that the fees are also expensive, and the transaction time is longer. I just choose not to make any transactions when network congestion occurs.","276":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? Who doesn't? All of us gets irritated when we're about to do a transaction and the fees are outrageous. The only people that aren't irritated with that are the miners. But except them, all of us are seriously not impressed when we have to pay more than the amount that we're about to transact. Anyway, even if it reaches to that point again which I am not hoping for, I'll not do any transaction and I won't be spending that much fees just to proceed my transaction unless it's really important and needed to be done.","277":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? Transaction fee is mostly considered base on the mempool and the number of inputs we are using for making the transaction, but by now, i don't expect to see many claiming that bitcoin transaction fee is still extremely high because what we are having now is very much affordable by all, there are times it get high and other times the transaction fee get low when the mempool is less congested.","278":"If you are a regular user of Bitcoin that's always sending and receiving BTC I think you would be very much interested in the fee movement, and if it happens that it jumps up this is likely to push you to other alternative crypto coins if you want to save some $$$ or force you to pay more on fees especially if you need this confirmed the soonest or not make the transaction at all as you wait for TX fees to drop which is very irritating in someway !! But understanding that some things are beyond our control and knowing very well that demand and supply has influence in the fees mechanics.. I think I wouldn't be very much irritated as other options are available to keep the wheels of crypto running","279":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? Right now, the fees are wonderful, well below $1. In my experience, sometimes the fees truly get high, but sometimes websites that monitor average transaction fees, as well as wallet recommendations can be wrong and make one overpay. So checking the fees on Mempool is a good practice. When the fees are above $10, it makes me upset, but I know that it is temporary, and I try to wait them out. If I need to sell urgently, I do it despite the fees, but that is pretty rare. Large fees show that Bitcoin is often not suitable as a form of money, at least not for daily usage and on-chain transactions.","280":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? I do. And I always hope it the network congestions doesn't happen on the day I need to change some bitcoin to fiat. I remember one time it happened and the my transaction was stuck for 78 hours. I had to use the bump feature and paid more on transaction fee because I had no option at that time and needed the money badly. The new strategy for this is to have a close friend send me some altcoin or usdt during this congestion period and pay back when then network is less congested and the fees have reduced. I do the same thing with funding my gambling wallet, I just use USDT.","281":"Since high fees are temporary why kill yourself worrying about it when you can just stay off transactions in the main time while it gets over? And of course people do use other network when it's very urgent because definitely bitcoin is not a cult so we don't have oats holding anyone to use only the bitcoin network. So if you get irritated with high tx fees, go to bed and sleep over it.","282":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? For some reason maybe for some people it will be inconvenient when the amount of bitcoin fees will obviously be a little annoying especially when we need it for a fast time but until now for me personally I have never felt that way because I rarely make transactions in bitcoin and when the network fee is high enough I prefer to wait a few days until the network fee is in accordance with what I expect because indeed the increase in network fees to date is not too long lasting and at most only a few days so I am more inclined to just wait in the end especially in this case for transactions as well I am just moving to the main wallet. So, i don't feel bothered by it. But even though it doesn't bother me i still don't expect a significant increase in bitcoin fees because after all, surely everyone wants the same thing with good enough speed but cheap fees because after all, that's probably the hope of most people.","283":"Especially at times when there is so much congestion, the fees increase by large amount. For small transactions, the fees is more than the transacted amount. Does it irritate you sometimes or you are fine with it ? To be honest with you, I wish there is alternative to this problems but when you complain, some Bitcoin supporters comes for you like you don't like Bitcoin. I like Bitcoin with all my heart, no digital currency comes close when it comes to everything about it but you see this congestion, it sucks when there too many transactions on the network and you are left with no choice than to wait because the asking fee is even bigger than what you want to send to another wallet. If you want to bye pass this problems in future, make sure you consolidate your inputs into a single place, it helps you spend low fees when it comes to times like this, consolidation of inputs helps you get small inputs and this help you mini reduces the amount you will spend for every input in your transaction because segwit address fees are actually low but this doesn't mean you wouldn't pay more if there is high congestion, you sometimes need to pay optimum to be able to get your transaction through.","284":"No content","285":"Quote BREAKING: The #Bitcoin Conference is unable to lock down Vice President Kamal Harris - Attacks her positions on BTC - claims it would been \u201ca disaster\u201d for her.

Republicans think abortion is \"baby murder\", and would do anything to stop it, including voting for somebody who would ban Bitcoin that's what it took. Democrats see the abortion criminalization Republicans want as a fundamental attack on their bodily autonomy, and more practically speaking, the end of safe sex in the United States because there's no recourse if one's birth control fails--so every act of sex in the country Republicans want must necessarily consider the possibility of there being a baby. And most people aren't in the position to have (another) baby. So hence Republicans are basically trying to... outlaw sex. So it's \"baby murder\" versus the end of sex.

It's another reason Kamala should not join the conference, at least don't join it will help her to avoid additional damage on her election program for very last months before the election.

I believe she was advised not to attend because sharing the same podium with Donald Trump can harm her reputation the way it happened to Joe Biden. She knows little about Bitcoin, so she might end up speaking ignorantly which will not be too good. It could also be that she doesn't want to mend fences with the crypto community because she is not a supporter of the technology.

As for country specific recession, bitcoin is definitely a good alternative because whenever currencies fails, people look towards other assets of which bitcoin has proven to be one of such reliable asset.

In the time of recession, the costs of goods may drop and income may also reduce unless you are working in some specific sectors.

But if we are to go with privacy and self-custody, then bitcoin is the best option for me. You have to be the one to decide what you really want and where you want to invest your money.

Bitcoin is better and has more potential, that doesn't mean you don't need knowledge and experience to rush into investing blindly and expect big profits. Financial markets don't work like that. It doesn't matter which market it is and profits will come from your knowledge, and not the market's decisions. If you have no knowledge, no experience but want to get rich quickly and think that just investing in bitcoin without doing anything else will achieve what you want. Then you will even lose everything, let alone how much profit you earn. Meanwhile, stock investors with knowledge and experience...will make more profits than you.","312":"It would have been a good thing to look at had Bitcoin been in existence before the beginning of the Great recession in 2007. But in general, Bitcoin has performed quite well compared to most if not all stocks from the time of its inception Let's not forget that back then, the price of Bitcoin was in cents. Today, I don't think we shall see yearly moves of 2,000%, like it was possible back then. So If a recession were to happen today, things may not be the same as they were 15 years ago.","313":"Can Bitcoin be a good investment over stocks in a recession period ? Also, explain why do you feel so ? It depends on the kind of stocks you are investing in. There are stocks that do well even in a time of recession. For example if a country is involved in fighting war despite the having a recession in it's country, individuals who invest in a company that produces ammunitions and other war stuffs will witness a rise in their investment even though the country is in a recession. Aside this, yes Bitcoin is my go to asset for investment during a recession or any economic downfall. It saves and preserves my wealth.","314":"Can Bitcoin be a good investment over stocks in a recession period ? In my opinion, bitcoin is better and that is why we are here and choose bitcoin. Also, explain why do you feel so ? Of course, we choose bitcoin because of its profits, bitcoin clearly brings significant profits and outperforms other investments, not just stocks. But apart from the profit factor, bitcoin is far superior as it is not just an investment but also provides us with use cases. With bitcoin, you can manage and store your assets yourself without depending on third parties, you can use it as currency, cross-border payment method...The stock market does not provide you with these facilities other than using them for investing.","315":"If you look at past data, you will easily get the answer to the question relative to your country because recession is rarely universal else it becomes global economic meltdown like we had in 2008 when bitcoin was not yet created. As for country specific recession, bitcoin is definitely a good alternative because whenever currencies fails, people look towards other assets of which bitcoin has proven to be one of such reliable asset. I remember in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of people invested in bitcoin and towards the end of the year, the price moon when stocks were crashing. I agree that stocks easily get affected by recession because during a recession company can easily get impacted with losses that\u2019s why you see things like companies reducing staffs and so. Having stocks here can cause panic and many people can start reducing their investment holdings leading to bearish periods for the stock, that\u2019s why the recession effect is dependent on the type of stock you invest in. Bitcoin on the other hand doesn\u2019t have a central body and a country recession doesn\u2019t affects it directly, but a global recession too will definitely affect the trend of bitcoin. During recession people are bent in to reducing their costs and more often volatile assets are the ones they do away with. A strong supply power as we know leads to fall in place","316":"BTC has been a good investment op, and whenever you make BTC your choice among other cryptocurrencies in the market, I guess it will allow you to accumulate profits that will make you to begin to see BTC as the king among other cryptocurrencies, which is what BTC is right now in the industry. If you have not stock your BTC for long period of years before, I will advise you to try it to hodl your BTC like 4 or 5 years before you can sell, you will agree with me that BTC investment is a good investment to put money in the bear run. I know you have seen other projects that is making you feel like BTC investment is not the best, just try the investment with what you can afford to lose, then you will believe BTC investment is the best.","317":"Can Bitcoin be a good investment over stocks in a recession period ? Also, explain why do you feel so ? I've been buying Bitcoin and not into stocks despite that many of my friends have been encouraging me to buy those. I've chosen to buy Bitcoin instead of it and that's why this is what I have and don't have stocks at all. But I don't know during the recession period. We're all believing that this is the hedge against inflation and it's been made during the 2008 crisis. It's able to survive during the pandemic and Ukraine-Russian war. So what's more to ask about it? Maybe the worst hasn't come yet but I believe that even on the toughest period of time that the entire world is going to go through with such recession, Bitcoin will survive no matter what happens. It's designed to survive it although it's been made as a peer to peer cryptocurrency but then its attributes have changed and became one of the best assets on this century.","318":"Can Bitcoin be a good investment over stocks in a recession period ? Also, explain why do you feel so ? Bitcoin is proven resilient in times of global economic crisis and inflation while stock market plummets since companies is the number one affected for recession period. Bitcoin is independent assets that doesn\u2019t rely on the global economy\/fiat. Also based on the Bitcoin price history. Bitcoin price is only moving upwards every cycle despite there\u2019s a correction occur. So this kind of assets is the best asset to invest in dire situation since you have an assurance that it will come back again no matter how hard down due to the recession.","319":"Not all stocks are the same though. Some stocks go down during a recession but not all. Defensive stocks are usually the stars of a recession period. It is because people will always have to use toothpaste, toilet paper, medicine etc\u2026 It is hard to beat these stocks during a recession. Btc on the other hand usually acts like a leveraged nasdaq index fund and the Nasdaq stocks are mostly tech stocks. Tech stocks don\u2019t do well in a recession so I think Bitcoin won\u2019t be an exception. In a recession I would go with the defensive stocks. P&G, Walmart, BAT, CVS, Costco, MCD, PEP are very popular and rock solid choices.","320":"Bitcoin is proven resilient in times of global economic crisis and inflation while stock market plummets since companies is the number one affected for recession period. Bitcoin is independent assets that doesn\u2019t rely on the global economy\/fiat. Well, that's in theory and it happened more in the beginning. Nowadays it is more and more related to the financial markets and its behavior is directly related to the liquidity in the market. Also based on the Bitcoin price history. Bitcoin price is only moving upwards every cycle despite there\u2019s a correction occur. So this kind of assets is the best asset to invest in dire situation since you have an assurance that it will come back again no matter how hard down due to the recession. This also happens with shares. Look at what happened in 2020, as discussed above. Both Bitcoin and stocks fell, only to end up recovering and surpassing highs in a short time. The difference is that Bitcoin is more volatile. It falls harder but recovers faster and rises higher.","321":"Can Bitcoin be a good investment over stocks in a recession period ? Also, explain why do you feel so ? Where you will be comfortable doing that is what you do, because we also have different strategies when it comes to investments here in the crypto space, or bitcoin. It is also difficult for us to rely on the answers of others to the question that we are looking for an answer to. It's even better because we ourselves do the actual research on such things. Now, if you really want to secure a profit, just hold bitcoin in the long term, and you will definitely get a profit this bull run, as long as you wait.","322":"Check this graph. Actually both of Bitcoin and S&P 500 have some correlation, when BTC dump, stock dump too. When BTC pump, stock pump too. It just Bitcoin has higher volatility than stock, so don't sell it whenever you're not need in hurry. I think Bitcoin isn't yet a safe thing to hold during crisis because during Covid pandemic, Bitcoin price once dump to $3K~ at that time.","323":"Bitcoin still the best investment for me and that works perfectly so far. I don't invest in stocks in a recession period because Bitcoin is enough for me besides of gold. I don't understand much about stocks and Bitcoin is more easier for me to understand and I don't have to know for very very details about Bitcoin. People just needs to learn about how to keeps Bitcoin with right so they will not feels worry with the scammers. But people must understand that Bitcoin is not a rich-quick scheme that will gives them a big profit in a short time. They must wait for some term, usually four years to see the price increases. But if you still wants to use stock instead Bitcoin, that will be no problem because we have our own choice. We choose Bitcoin because we already see how Bitcoin perform so far. Bitcoin is not disappointed us and even gives us a big profit if we can holds it for some time.","324":"Although it is hard to say but I doubt it. The thing about recession is that unlike inflation (that would shoot bitcoin price up) it forces people to liquidate their assets and they always start from the riskiest assets which bitcoin can be called that. So the sell pressure caused by the recession like this could lead to drops and even crashes depending on the severity of the recession and the panic sell! In fact I've been saying that the only reason why we haven't seen a bull run that looks like previous bull runs in the past 2 years is the ongoing and worsening recession in most of the world.","325":"I still dont get why people think stocks is like gambling while bitcoin is not. Both are equally volatile and have their own set of risks with overlap. Does not make either of them good or bad, they have their own unique profile. I believe Bitcoin is way more volatile than stocks. The only reason many believe that Bitcoin is good for investment in a recession period is because they believe it is a hedge against inflation other than that I can't hear any more reason why Bitcoin is good to invest in during those times. Aside from that during a recession most stocks fall and Bitcoin does not follow suit with traditional stocks so, it can be said that the price of Bitcoin is independent which may increase in value while the stock value collapse. Although this has not been proven yet many believe in this case due to how the Bitcoin market behaves.","326":"No content","327":"Why is bitcoin price heavily affected by everything from the United States, when there\u2019s a major news in America you\u2019ll see speculators talking about how bitcoin price could go up or down as a result of that news. I saw that USA has the highest number of bitcoin miners, is anything related to why most of this news is affecting the price of bitcoin and is this how it will continue forever. Even when Biden decided to step down from the presidential race, many speculates that bitcoin could go up as a result of that.","328":"You make a good point: Bitcoin's price is deeply tied to US politics. Maybe this why crypto spending in the US election has surpassed every other industry including Big Oil and healthcare. It's worth noting that this year is the last time anybody can credibly say that Bitcoin can't be manipulated by governments like (say) sovereign currencies can. In fact, Bitcoin can (and is) manipulated by governments--especially the US--more than any currency in history. The price of Bitcoin now hangs on the words of every US politician--far more than the value of the US dollar does, for instance...","329":"We started a whole thread about this in the Spanish forum. But we didn't come to a really convincing conclusion yet. Regarding crypto users, the US seems to be only third in the world - of course there are only rough estimates, but it seems India and even China (despite the heavy restrictions) have more crypto users than the US, of course due to their larger population (see Triple-A estimates). Main factors may be: 1) the US as the leading economy in general, and the presence of US news in the world's media headlines, 2) the US as the place where most modern \"tech companies\" reside -- in reality, most modern software companies, because industrial tech is mostly located in Asia 3) several founders of big cryptocurrency businesses (Binance, for example) and also altcoins are from the US or located in the US, 4) the Wall Street as the world's \"money hotspot\" and synonym of Capitalism in general, which is important above all for financial products like ETFs, but also crypto stocks, 5) of course, in recent years also the large mining sector (35-45% of the world's hashpower, according to estimates) I think while these points of course are important, the importance for the crypto market in my opinion is disproportional. Much more bullish than a crypto-friendly legislation in the US, where already 15% of all people have owned crypto-assets, would be a crypto-friendly legislation in India for example, or a lifting of the restrictions in China. I'm thus quite bullish regarding the developments in Hong Kong (the authorization of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs there), because they can hint to a change in the Communist Party's views about Bitcoin and cryptos, and possible further removal of crypto restrictions in China.","330":"1) the US as the leading economy in general, and the presence of US news in the world's media headlines, Among all the other keynotes I will simply say this is my strongest point, I think no matter how we try to make an argument for this, American been the leading economy means that\u2019s it\u2019s adoption of a new technology most especially when it has to do with the economy will have a major impact on the news than most countries, this doesn\u2019t mean other country\u2019s economy news or bitcoin related laws doesn\u2019t have impact on it too. Remember when China banned mining or when the energy supply decreased due to the Russian\/Ukraine war, they had their own impact too It's worth noting that this year is the last time anybody can credibly say that Bitcoin can't be manipulated by governments like (say) sovereign currencies can. In fact, Bitcoin can (and is) manipulated by governments--especially the US--more than any currency in history. The price of Bitcoin now hangs on the words of every US politician--far more than the value of the US dollar does, for instance... I don\u2019t think, bitcoin isn\u2019t manipulated rather investors are manipulated into making decisions which we all know will affect bitcoin, bitcoin price is dependent on the demand and supply of it, it is the investors that react to economic news which isn\u2019t new. People feed on the words of the US election and make their decision. If a news broke out today and everyone doesn\u2019t reacts that wouldn\u2019t affect the market, so it is the supply and demand of investors that manipulate the bitcoin price","331":"Why is bitcoin price heavily affected by everything from the United States, when there\u2019s a major news in America you\u2019ll see speculators talking about how bitcoin price could go up or down as a result of that news. I am guessing it would be because of USA\u2019s general role in the economy of the world. The dollar is the reserve currency of the world and the fall or rise of the dollar can have massive impact on bitcoin. It\u2019s also because of sheer market size. It\u2019s difficult to say accurately just how many americans are investors of bitcoin but we can assume that there\u2019s enough that any political or economic situation happening in USA can affect the investors and therefore affect the market. Quote Even when Biden decided to step down from the presidential race, many speculates that bitcoin could go up as a result of that. Well that\u2019s because Biden\u2019s opposition is Trump who has been constantly mentioning bitcoin. Biden stepping down just increases the chances of Trump winning and by extension his ideas about bitcoin.","332":"Remember when China banned mining or when the energy supply decreased due to the Russian\/Ukraine war, they had their own impact too That's correct, but from the US even minor news about presidential candidates (!), i.e. not even government actions, impact in price. The China mining ban was intimately related to Bitcoin's core ecosystem. And mining was very concentrated in China until 2021. Regarding the Ukraine war, it mostly seems to have impacted due to its influence on inflation in almost all major markets, and that impacting on interest rates globally -- including in the US. Interest rate changes in major countries are not so much \"news\" stories, but fundamental reasons why people invest more or less in Bitcoin, because of the increased competition of traditional financial products (like bonds) when the rates are high. To be fair, the US is one of the few countries where presidential candidates even used Bitcoin in their campaign. The only other country I know where this was a major topic is El Salvador. Even in Argentina for example, when last year a \"Libertarian\" (Javier Milei) won the presidential election, Bitcoin wasn't a significant campaign topic, although some minor politicians from Milei's party have publicly supported cryptocurrencies.","333":"I don\u2019t think, bitcoin isn\u2019t manipulated rather investors are manipulated into making decisions which we all know will affect bitcoin, bitcoin price is dependent on the demand and supply of it, it is the investors that react to economic news which isn\u2019t new. People feed on the words of the US election and make their decision. If a news broke out today and everyone doesn\u2019t reacts that wouldn\u2019t affect the market, so it is the supply and demand of investors that manipulate the bitcoin price A common criticism of the US Dollar and other sovereign currencies is that they can be manipulated by politics: governments can inflate their value by issuing new currency, and politics is what controls that. Hence political winds can alter your investment in that currency, which makes it a poor investment. Bitcoin has the same problem, but ten times worse...","334":"Bitcoin is just one among many that's heavily affected by US hegemony. In one way or another, the US leads the world. Even back in my small town, my father's old radio which broadcasts local stations relays to us what's happening in the US. I guess all eyes are in the US, perhaps because everything's there. As regards Bitcoin, the mining is there. The ATMs are there. All kinds of platforms offering services all over the world are there. The most influential ETFs in the world are based there. The richest Bitcoin owners are from there. The list goes on. But I guess this is also partly because we're fixated on the US all the time. We don't have to. But it has already gone to a ridiculous extent that even the most inconsequential event happening in the US like Snoop Dogg shitting on his pants could be associated with the next direction the Bitcoin price would take.","335":"Bitcoin is heavily intertwined in our financial systems, see the ETFs, different companies and governments holding their share of Bitcoin. Fiat has a direct correlation with Bitcoin because of how fiat moves and how the economic outlook is supposed to be. Think of how S&P or NASDAQ moves when Jerome Powell speaks. A poor market outlook results in a general downward trend for the majority of the market save for inflation hedge like precious metals. It'll be naive to think that there is any currency out there which is free from the influence of news and politics anywhere in the world, much less from one of the biggest and most prosperous countries. Cryptos like Bitcoin will always be affected by politics, same as literally anything that has any value in the world. Think of this: If one of the biggest countries in the world shows signs that they'll be easing policies on Bitcoin, then obviously the optimism on Bitcoin would be high -> higher prices. You also highlighted an important phrase: Speculation. Crypto in general can still be treated like a speculative currency, where traders are eager to predict the general trend of Bitcoin, if it'll rise or fall. This would obviously lead to the market being more volatile than usual.","336":"Why is bitcoin price heavily affected by everything from the United States, when there\u2019s a major news in America you\u2019ll see speculators talking about how bitcoin price could go up or down as a result of that news. I saw that USA has the highest number of bitcoin miners, is anything related to why most of this news is affecting the price of bitcoin and is this how it will continue forever. Even when Biden decided to step down from the presidential race, many speculates that bitcoin could go up as a result of that. Even the entire world economy is under the influence and domination of the US, and bitcoin is also a part of the world economy , so it is not surprising that it cannot avoid the impact of the US . The US market is considered the center of the entire world from finance, technology, military, economics...so you should not be surprised to see them having a significant impact on most fields and industries . Some say bitcoin is decentralized and not controlled by anyone, that's not wrong but don't forget that bitcoin is being used by people and people are also part of the world economy and we cannot avoid the impact of the world economy. So don't expect bitcoin to be immune to the outside world.","337":"It's because medias and people always like to correlate one thing with another thing. We can't deny there are many traders out there, they usually rely their decision on global news, so whenever x news from x medias launched, they will make x decision. But, for long term holders, these news are useless. Bitcoin price will keep moving whathever the news and politics comes up, after all the longest holder will win. Bitcoin is decentralized, anyone can move create and send coins, miners can move to wherever they want, there's no rules miners must mine in US.","338":"Why is bitcoin price heavily affected by everything from the United States, when there\u2019s a major news in America you\u2019ll see speculators talking about how bitcoin price could go up or down as a result of that news.

Even when Biden decided to step down from the presidential race, many speculates that bitcoin could go up as a result of that. I mean when you have the two options that are or were up until recently available you have a party that is pro crypto and one that is anti crypto. You also have the US financial markets launching Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds and so there is also that factor which obviously greatly opens up new institutional investors to flood into the market. I mean those two right there are two good examples, but that doesn't mean that the US is the only one who has an effect on BTC. Look at El Salvador & countries that embrace crypto.","339":"Why is bitcoin price heavily affected by everything from the United States, when there\u2019s a major news in America you\u2019ll see speculators talking about how bitcoin price could go up or down as a result of that news.

To be fair, not just Bitcoin, but every financial market could be tied to American news and Politics, like the Fed's CPI or the currently hotly contested US Presidential and Vice Presidential race. Why? Most likely as one powerful nation, and then their USD as the world's reserved, the world's strongest economy. Perhaps if Bitcoin will really mature, perhaps we can see it decoupling from US economy, and we might be independent with it. We have stable coins tied to dollar, what if we get a stable coins that is new, like tied to Japanese Yen? Could it shift everything? My point is that we need varied currencies to lessen dependency on US.","340":"This US factor only began because of uncle Gary's unfair crackdowns and regulation through enforcement tactics against the cryptospace. On Trump, he declared that he his procrypto. I reckon presently the leader in the polls and surveys will very much make the price of bitcoin bullish or bearish because if Trump is leading, we might have procrypto policies in America which will certainly make the cryptospace pump. However, if it is a candidate from the Democrats that is leading, we might have more uncle Gary and crackdowns which is very bearish.","341":"This US factor only began because of uncle Gary's unfair crackdowns and regulation through enforcement tactics against the cryptospace.

Well, Bitcoin went up 500% under president Biden, so it makes no sense to call Biden or his presidency \"anti-Bitcoin\". But you are saying that Bitcoin is tied to... US politics. Just like the US dollar is. So much for Bitcoin being an \"independent\" currency and all that and is outside of the reach of any government. But holders of US Dollars don't hang on every nuance of the US elections to see if their investment is going to go up or down. But to hear Bitcoin holders tell it, US politics is the only thing keeping their investment afloat. The supposedly \"government-proof\" Bitcoin needs the right political faction in Washington to be in place to survive. I guess this is where rhetoric meets reality? Bitcoin starts life under libertarian ideals of a government-free world, and ends up holding its hand out for government alms like Ayn Rand's looters from Atlas Shrugged. Crazy stuff .","342":"Well, Bitcoin went up 500% under president Biden, so it makes no sense to call Biden or his presidency \"anti-Bitcoin\". From the bottom in bear market, price will recover to its previous ATH and in a new market cycle, in the past it always makes new ATH. 500% from bottom is not an unbelievable recovery and growth of Bitcoin from bear market price. It happens many times in past cycles, not only recent years under Biden Presidency term. If the President is not Biden, but Trump or anyone else, Bitcoin will not care about it and simply complete its own market cycle, price cycle from bull-bear-bull-bear market. A Presidency term and administration is Anti- or Pro-Bitcoin is one of elements but don't decide or is able to break Bitcoin market cycle. Bitcoin market cycle","343":"That might be because the vast majority of crypto trading is done in the United States, by large companies, if not by people who try to make a financial killing. Also, policies that the USA makes about crypto seem to have a worldwide effect. For example, when the FBI recommended Americans to not use no-KYC exchanges, Phoenix, Wasabi, etc. all blocked their services to US people.","344":"You do realise that USA is a major player in the crypto currency community, don't you op? They are a major player in literally anything important happening across the world which is why they are the supreme powerhouse that they are today.

Anything that can bring them money, they will gladly accept, and a large economy easily absorbs new things. The influence they have on the further course and development is more obvious for discussion because they prefer to adapt things to themselves rather than being flexible themselves.","346":"Being affected by something doesn't mean it is \"tied\" to it. US dollar being a major global fiat and having major businesses including centralized exchanges in US and also having many American bitcoin investors makes it so that any US news affect the bitcoin market. But that's pretty much the same with any major player in the scene like China. For example over the past decade each time Chinese government has made a major move regarding bitcoin, the price has been significantly affected. But that doesn't mean bitcoin price is tied to Chinese news and politics.","347":"No content","348":"I\u2019m not a coder but I know for good coins, technical characteristics are very important and want to share a good piece of education. When we review Bitcoin vs. Ethereum, it is a very complex topic, where many arguments need to be evaluated. Let\u2019s make a list here about Bitcoin vs. Ethereum topic. Important: Do your research which devs are building a coin When we exchange your valuable Bitcoin or Ethereum for a different alt coin, we really need to research which devs are behind it. It is very important because devs are making a project successful, or if it\u2019s a bad dev, can make it fail. A good dev should have huge knowledge in crypto, coding and computer science because he needs to achieve a secure and fast blockchain. If he does not make a good code, such platform can be hacked and coins will be lost and lose value because of price dump. Ethereum offers more fast and cheap transactions When compared between Bitcoin and Ethereum, in general Ethereum\u2019s transactions are faster and cheaper. It is a very important point when evaluating a coin. But Ethereum\u2019s network has much baggage like NFT\u2019s and it can happen for Ethereum to be more expensive at times, compared to Bitcoin. So, Ethereum transactions are not necessarily cheaper. Bitcoin has SegWit to lower transaction fees SegWit offers us compared to Legacy or nested SegWit really low transaction fees and it will reduce our costs paid for transaction fees a lot. SegWit transactions are simply smaller in size compared to legacy transactions because all witness data (signatures) is separated from transaction data. As a result, we get a lower fee per transaction vbyte. Bitcoin\u2019s SegWit offers increased Block Capacity Bitcoin has a limit of transactions in terms of transaction size for each Block: a limited number of transactions can only be fitted into each Bitcoin block, limiting Bitcoin\u2019s capacity in terms of transaction size per new block. SegWit allows more transactions to be fitted into each block. By separating all witness data, SegWit effectively decreases size limits for each transaction and effectively increases Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit, which helps to process more transactions per block. So, SegWit actively helps to reduce congestion in Bitcoin\u2019s mempool. Overall, using SegWit addresses will help us to reduce transaction costs, have a better network performance and future-proofing for additional improvements and features for Bitcoin. Reasons for and against Pos vs. PoW Quite contrary to PoS, PoW is very hard or almost impossible to compromise. Not so for PoS, where more attack vectors can be found. For example, PoS can be abused by rich stakers. Many PoS projects have a so-called pre-mining of coins allocated to the team and the team can abuse such pre-mined coins to gain influence about project decisions. A large pre-mine is making a project centralized in many ways and devs can gain much influence by staking a large amount of PoS coins. PoW is not having such issues. A similar problem is called \"nothing at stake\", where attackers benefit from no cost to stake ETH or similar PoS coins. Should a fork occur, no matter if the fork is a friendly, accidental or a malicious attempt to rewrite history and reverse transactions, it\u2019s a given strategy for any staker to stake on every chain. By doing so, he will get a reward no matter which fork will succeed and he will have no additional cost to do so. In PoW, such a problem is not happening because PoW always means work (spending electricity) needs to be done. A cost occurs for every miner and he can\u2019t mine on multiple chains because mining of a different chain means an extra cost. Bitcoin is well reviewed When Bitcoin was invented, it was set up to be a big security. Hacks should be impossible and get prevented by good code. Bitcoin attracted and still has a very large community of really educated developers. Bitcoin has a very reliable coder community, where flaws will be detected early before implementation and no risks are being taken. Many much smaller coins have a very flawed code review process. A large and educated coder community reviewing code during testing times is an important advantage for Bitcoin. And luckily, it saves us from possible hacks, when hackers are prevented from detecting flaws faster because all flaws are removed before implementation. We have seen so many hacks, where a flawed code was exploited and people lost money, like for Altcoin cross chain bridges recently or when Terra Luna failed. Still, people are buying coins from unreliable coders like Tron from Justin Sun or even weaker DeFi coins like Acala Stablecoin from Polkadot\u2019s supplier Web 3. Unfortunately, some people will only learn after a loss. Some coins are very centralized and have a single point of failure like Solana, when it was down several times or devs have much power like in Binance Coin or Tron. And DeFi coins can easily print some more coins \/ tokens into existence. Bitcoin is having a big advantage here. Bitcoin has PoW It is big controversy for a long time, if a coin makes PoW or PoS, like it was for Ethereum [ETH]. Not for Bitcoin because Bitcoin developers have decided PoW is best because of security. From what Experts have said so far, PoW is very hard or almost impossible to compromise instead of PoS, where more attack vectors can be found. Like Corona, we should trust majority of experts who have education and experience in an issue. Satoshi implemented PoW not PoS because Satoshi knew. He was very experienced and called it right. PoS can be abused by rich stakers and makes a project centralized in many ways like premined coins and devs can create much influence by staking a large amount of PoS coins. PoW is not having such issues. Security is Bitcoin\u2019s priority As for a safe cryptocurrency, security standards are very important. First point, we need security standards and Satoshi implemented it right himself, when he developed Bitcoin. Early Bitcoin developers added more security standards. Second point is after some time, to NOT remove such security standards. First point and especially second point are relevant to many Altcoins, which is a big issue for Altcoins. Many Altcoins don\u2019t offer anymore to create private and public keys to prove ownership of funds and access it. It is very concerning and seems mind blowing to many experienced coders. For example, when creating a Solana wallet or similar new Altcoins. Altcoin developers are not focusing on security. Or even MEW is bitching around more and more every time going away by implementing insecure patches. We need to have our private key offline. Many Altcoins are leaving people vulnerable which is very concerning. Bitcoin is better like Electrum for example. Its design is not so nice but Electrum is good tech and recommended by many experts. Bitcoin is still having very high security standards today because of Bitcoin does not want to build a hype coin, Bitcoin wants to build a safe coin. It is our duty to select a safe coin instead of an unsafe hype coin.","349":"Let\u2019s make a list here about Bitcoin vs. Ethereum topic. It is unnecessary to compare Bitcoin and Ethereum. Chronologically, with what already happened, if Bitcoin was not created, Ethereum was not created too. Vitalik Buterin was enlightened by Bitcoin so that he believed in decentralization and built Ethereum. Years later, he moved from decentralization with Proof of Work to centralization with Proof of Stake. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer with Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum even with Proof of Work, was still centralized with majority of ETH in hands of Vitalik. Quote Security is Bitcoin\u2019s priority Bitcoin network is stronger and more secure than altcoin blockchains. https:\/\/howmanyconfs.com\/ If you want to see Ethereum, use Wayback machine. https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200522061503\/https:\/\/howmanyconfs.com\/ With that wayback machine time point, you have information for comparison: 6 confirmations of Bitcoin blockchain equal to 1h 7min but with Ethereum blockchain, to gain similar security, you will need 887 confirmations that equivalent to 3h 16mins. Do you see big difference?","350":"ETH is something completely different from bitcoin. It's a platform on which other projects are built and it's more of a work in progress kind of project that changes as it goes. A great example of these changes is going from PoW to PoS. Bitcoin is more of a store of value type of asset, a digital gold, the first cryptocurrency, a commodity. ETH has a lot of weak links for instance its founders being alive and open for attacks from government agencies. A live leader can be sued, blackmailed, arrested, even assassinated if needed. He's only human who if forced to dump his stash will do it. People go insane all the time. There's no assurance that Vitalik won't end up in a mental facility in a few years. If I were to choose one of these I'd always choose bitcoin.","351":"Although some consider this a big topic but in the end this remains the same as the previous discussion where there is nothing to argue about because after all bitcoin is much bigger and better so we cannot assume that this will be a competition because even Ethereum itself eventually follows bitcoin both in terms of price and their journey. There is no avoiding that ETH is still very good for altcoins right now but that doesn't mean bitcoin and ETH can be compared because in the end the conditions remain the same where bitcoin remains the first in terms of choice and after that only ETH and other altcoins. I think for this discussion in the end it will continue like that where we will remain and choose bitcoin if faced with 2 choices even though ETH is not a bad thing but in the end bitcoin remains the best.","352":"When we exchange your valuable Bitcoin or Ethereum for a different alt coin, Ethereum itself is an altcoin itself and using bitcoin and ethereum in the same context doesn't make much sense! One is decentralized, secure and does what it was supposed to do and the other is centralized, mutable, buggy and doesn't do what it was promised to do. Quote Ethereum offers more fast and cheap transactions No it doesn't. Actually under same circumstance (same level of usage) ethereum transactions are far more expensive than bitcoin's. We saw that during the 2017 ether pump due to the ICO craze where it became nearly impossible to use due to high fees. Ethereum also has slower transactions because as it was pointed out 1 confirmation on the mutable ethereum blockchain is not the same as 1 confirmation on immutable bitcoin blockchain. Quote When compared between Bitcoin and Ethereum, in general Ethereum\u2019s transactions are faster and cheaper. It is a very important point when evaluating a coin. It is more important to first understand what \"fast\" means. Fast transaction doesn't mean when they get included in a block, it means when they become irreversible. One confirmation on Bitcoin blockchain is usually equal to dozens up to in certain cases thousands of confirmation on other chains, and that's assuming they too have immutable blockchains. For an altcoin with a mutable blockchain where they have a history of rolling back blocks, no number of confirmation can be considered truly safe anymore. Quote it can happen for Ethereum to be more expensive at times, compared to Bitcoin. No, that's impossible simply because Ethereum is useless (it's only used for hyped up short lived ICO garbage and its family) and also most importantly ether has an unlimited supply so like fiat it will continue losing value in long run not gain value. Quote SegWit transactions are simply smaller in size compared to legacy transactions because all witness data (signatures) is separated from transaction data. SegWit transactions have a smaller weight not size. The witness data is also NOT separated from the transaction data. It is still part and parcel of the transaction. Quote a limited number of transactions can only be fitted into each Bitcoin block, All blockchain based cryptocurrencies have a block size cap so they can only include a finite number of transactions in each block. Quote By separating all witness data, SegWit effectively decreases size limits for each transaction and effectively increases Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit, As I said witness is not separated. The block and transaction structure is changed so that transactions can contain more data and blocks to contain more transactions in a backward compatible way. Quote A large pre-mine is making a project centralized And ethereum has a massive premine ... Quote Still, people are buying coins from unreliable coders like Tron from Justin Sun or even weaker DeFi coins like Acala Stablecoin from Polkadot\u2019s supplier Web 3. Unfortunately, some people will only learn after a loss. Well, such people aren't actually buying \"coins\", they are making bets on random stuff trying to make some money gambling. They might as well be in a race track betting on running horses or something like that! Quote It is big controversy for a long time, if a coin makes PoW or PoS, like it was for Ethereum [ETH]. Not for Bitcoin because Bitcoin developers have decided PoW is best because of security. It's not exactly a controversy, it is a topic that has generated a lot of FUD. And the choice of PoW is not because it is \"best\", but because there is no alternative. For example PoS is just fundamentally flawed so it is not even worth considering since it was proven at least a decade ago that it is not a viable algorithm.","353":"Ethereum offers more fast and cheap transactions I don't think you're right with this, bitcoin transaction is cheap and you cant compare it to that of the other network mentioned, maybe you get the wrong idea or make mistake about the intention you meant from this statement, bitcoin transaction is fast, cheap and reliable, so on the aspect of the cheaper transaction fee rate, bitcoin is cheaper than ethereum network, know this in case you dont.","354":"As op mentioned in the post, there is a risk on Pos, but for that there must be big holder with a huge part of the coins, the risk is the same that a 51% attack on the bitcoin blockchain, if some one is holding more than 50% of the coins then he can try that attack, but I don't considera this risk on ETH because no one is holding that big amount of coins.","355":"Real big transformative ideas in computer science are very rare. A solution for the double-spending problem in distributed databases was published in 2008. Since the beginning of the commercial internet in the early \u201990s, that was one of the pitfalls to be overcome in the goal of creating a pure digital asset. Satoshi solved that problem in such an elegant way. All other design decisions made by Satoshi were also elegant, such as creating absolute scarcity by setting a finite supply of Bitcoin, choosing EC secp256k1, etc. Regarding creating distributed applications, honestly, I would use the Java Virtual Machine.","356":"No content","357":"I've sold all the BTC I own, but what the German government did got me thinking.

Keep doing this until you hit 1 btc. How do you stop yourself from selling?? Uhhh why would you even be attempted to sell before you reach 1 btc when you say your goal is 1 btc? That doesn't make any sense. Just DCA continuously over the years. If 1 BTC is your goal and you are going to stick to that as your goal then keep saving until you hit 1 btc. Keep saving beyond 1 btc if you want, there is really no reason to ever stop saving money as long as you have income to save. But also you can spend your bitcoin whenever you have something you want to spend it on. Personally I find retirement is the best thing to save your bitcoin for, but it could also be a house, or smaller stuff along the way.

In my opinion, regulation is a necessary evil. There are projects based on crypto known as ICO which allowed people to buy a token on ETH ERC-20 blockchain and the holders would have some rights. Almost all the projects failed and the investors were angry. This does not mean that innovation was there, most of them if innovative enough, would have gone for the mainstream tech market, which they did not. See how cunning they were? They knew that the crypto users were gullible enough to fool like that and thus stayed away from mainstream\/legally protected markets. Sadly legal approaches did not work much for ICOs for the same reason or paperwork related difficulty.

It is better to leave it to the authorities to find the answer to this question. - Will overly restrictive regulations drive innovation offshore?

Because I don't want to be blamed or responsible to anyone because even I myself have no guarantee that my bitcoin investment will be successful. I also don't seem to care which of them has invested in bitcoin because each person has a life and each person has their own choices.

I advised him to invest in bitcoin, but then he only looked at risk and not profit, he didn't want to take risk, I tried to convince him many times that investment in bitcoin has high profit as well as risk, (at that time bitcoin was worth 20K to within 30K) but he did not understand in any way. Then I realized that there was no point in explaining it to him, so I gave up trying to explain it to him. And I continued to invest like myself. My friend was surprised when the price of Bitcoin broke its all-time high before the halving and then only regretted it. He got confused and said I'll invest now i.e. when bitcoin price is above 70K he decided to invest, LOL. Then I told him that now there is no profit in investing, now the price of Bitcoin is very high. I told him about investing after a few days and after the price of Bitcoin slowly fell when it reached 60K I told him to start investing. He is now investing according to his ability using DCA method.","404":"I only influenced my parents.

It was not even about Bitcoin, I invested the money on alt and he made 5x of the money, and I gave it back to him, he was very happy, what I did notice was that he was ready to lose that money, most people today call everything a scam, including Bitcoin, you will have peace of mind if you keep it to yourself.","406":"I only influenced my parents.

The point I paid attention to is that I did not try to persuade or pressure my friend to invest, I just told him what I knew.

He is my friend who is doing far better than me today financially because he caught the vision on time. He kept disturbing me to invest in bitcoin back then but I was reluctant.

Some of them were appreciative and have come back to thank me because I exposed them to information about an opportunity that many of their peers have no knowledge of.

But there was this one time I was chatting to my friend over beers and he seemed seriously pumped about the whole Bitcoin concept after I rambled on about it and even transferred a bit of money over to dip his toes in. For a few weeks he was stoked because the price kept climbing and his investment was looking sweeter by the day. But welp, as so often happens in crypto markets, a correction dip came. Value started dropping hard and fast. He totally panicked and sold at a loss just wanting out. Poor guy! I haven't heard him talk about Bitcoin or investing since, lol. Guess I scared him off!

Bitcoin investment is suitable for those who show their desire by themselves but if someone is not interested then we cannot immediately teach him about Bitcoin.

Provided you have internet and some sort of computer device you can download a Bitcoin wallet and take payments. You don\u2019t have to worry about the customer coming from a country with poor currency. It\u2019s also much faster than Western Union Wire Transfers. You can also make payments with it anywhere in the world that a merchant accepts it. Non-Institutional. Bitcoin is not tied to any government, corporation, religion, or institution. If you live in a country with a failing government or failing currency you can still do business and not worry about losing all your hard earned money. Lower Fees. As mentioned before the fees are much cheaper than Western Unions. Security. The Bitcoin network has never been hacked. Provided you properly store your private keys your Bitcoin is safe. Non-banked. Bitcoin does not require a bank to use. This means that you can take online payments from people who do not have bank accounts. You also won\u2019t have all those pesky bank fees. You also don\u2019t have to worry about your Bitcoin being frozen arbitrarily by a bank. New Customers.

We know to benefits of accepting Bitcoin as a payment method do you want to share your experience of using bitcoin as a payment method for an item or commodity because? I love great customer service and I would choose a Fiat only business over a business where Bitcoin is accepted if their customer service is bad. Therefore the benefits of Bitcoin as a payment method which one of it is new customers depends on the service delivery. A shop or business that puts customers first will have new customers while one that doesn't won't have even if they announce having Bitcoin as a payment method.","422":"The most important benefit of accepting Bitcoin i could think of at the moment is the fact it's like an payment with possibility of more profits. Let's say if I have received $10000 as a payment and in a week the akue f Bitcoin increases by 10% then I would have $1100 if I hodl it. But I strongly object to your point saying it's cheaper than western union, I think you should check the transaction fee during bull run or when Bitcoin's value is higher.","423":"Non-refundable.

Though the points you've highlighted here are correct, I still can't understand your first point mind explaining? Bitcoin can do a lot !ore, providing a wide range of payments and economical possibilities in the crypto market. With Bitcoin, you can make cross boarder transactions with less fees and faster compared to the local country across boarder payments. Having Bitcoin makes you your own bank and literally, you cannot be controlled by the government or any institutional body except you use centralized bodies that a payment system. Though we can say that Bitcoin adoption is gradually increasing, but not every county is yet to permit it as a payment system for their citizens making your last point not totally agreeable.

But I strongly object to your point saying it's cheaper than western union, I think you should check the transaction fee during bull run or when Bitcoin's value is higher. It's not an advantage for a business owner who needs to pay bills and operates on small margin. You may not know this, but most resellers get less than 5% in profit. This is especially visible in the cost of gasoline, but also new cars, apartments, and many other goods and services. Let's say you have a car dealership and the cars sell for $50k and you get 5%, so 2,5k in profit for every car you sell, but you have to pay staff, electricity bills. When you subtract all of that you end up with maybe 1k in your pocket. By the time you're done bitcoin goes down 10% and you have $250 less. It can go up, but you can't wait, you have bills to pay, so you sell at a loss.","425":"For me accepting crypto as a payment method has its advantages and disadvantage. Some might see it as expensive due to the transaction fee, and also they would need to wait till it has been confirmed. We should also consider the price, we all know that crypto is volatile so the price could move up or down which could give the receiver more profit or lose in their business.","426":"As i've said over and over again, and I will forever stand by this statement, bitcoin will never reach it's full potential without being an elite payment system. I know most are shifting to the \"digital real estate\/store of value\" take, which I'm not disagreeing with, but why can't it be all three is what I don't understand. I mean..why not? The devs are continuing to implement things such as segwit, taproot (thanks to our own Gmaxwell) and other upgrades to help with transaction speeds (I imagine transaction costs as well, but not smart enough to know if that's a big focus for them or not, or if they go hand in hand).","427":"Op if you accept bitcoin as a payment method in your business then it is refundable. I have seen people refund bitcoins back to the sender because of a mistake made by the sender. So if you send bitcoin give seller and you decided to leave the good and not to buy again the. The seller would refund the coins back to you. And that is where the transaction fee will come, and the buyer of the goods will bear the two transaction fee and that is where bitcoin p2p was generated. And at the beginning when Alice and Bob did their first transaction the fee was very small. The other factors might true and not the second option.","428":"For me accepting crypto as a payment method has its advantages and disadvantage.

Well, of course, there's always a disadvantage. There are no perfect things in this world, and I agree with the disadvantage you have mentioned. The most common problem they might encounter if they accept bitcoin payments is the high transaction fees, and sometimes the network is too congested, so expect a slot or delayed receiving and sending of bitcoin assets. Well, it can't be helped. All technology has its own down side, and it can't be helped. There are always limitations in a technology, and that's why implementing bitcoin as a payment method should be thought through and planned well because it's not going to be easy, especially for those small businesses that want to add bitcoin as their payment method. But the most important thing is that no matter what the downside of bitcoin is, it has more advantages and benefits, and I think we mostly know what it is and how bitcoin has become a great opportunity for us and a good source of income.","429":"The most important benefit of accepting Bitcoin i could think of at the moment is the fact it's like an payment with possibility of more profits.

A lot of businesses use bitcoin to basically allure and lead customers into their business.

In such cases, don't convert your btc to USD or other currencies. You will only lose if you are in a hurry and have urgent needs. But if not, you can always wait for the btc market to increase its value. For now, the major benefit that I am seeing is that the possibility to earn profits is high because of its volatile nature. But you need to understand that it depends on when will you cash out this currency. Other benefits that you can derive from this currency - > cross-border payments with very low transaction fees > anonymous payments, no need to get the credentials of your clients > you can transact at the comfort of your home","432":"New Customers. Make an announcement that you are accepting Bitcoin and it will draw attention from the cryptocurrency crowd. Believe it or not there are more of them then you think. If you offer poor business services, or sell bad products, or even that you sell good products and offer good services but have poor marketing, deciding to add bitcoin as a method of payment to your business will not automatically increase your customer base. There will be people who will hear that you have added bitcoin as a method of payment in your business, but hearing about it is not equal to action and many people will hear about it but will never still visit your business to make a transaction in bitcoins.","433":"OP, You may have thought that using Bitcoin as a payment method for businesses has many advantages, but it also has several disadvantages. Maybe the payment system of the business can be done through Bitcoin to attract customers but in this case if you talk about Bitcoin transaction fees there are definitely problems. Assuming you have sold a product worth ten dollars, if an additional fee of 10 dollars is added to the price of your product, then the total cost will be 10 dollars plus ten dollars, i.e. 20 dollars. In this case, a buyer will never bear such an additional fee. Again if for some reason the buyer wants to refund the money from you and in that case you have to bear additional fees again, there will be a huge change of capital in your business and you are guaranteed to have a huge loss in your business. Considering all these problems, you would never want to approve Bitcoin as a payment system for any business.","434":"Bitcoin has got several advantages when compared with our traditional system of making payments. Some of those are what you have mentioned in the OP but even that still depends on what angle your looking at it or making this comparison.

Someone can\u2019t just call the Bitcoin company and make up a lie that they never received their product. Once you have the Bitcoin it\u2019s yours. Bitcoin been non refundable counts towards the positive as well as the negative. This is so in the sense that, Merits: Once you\u2019ve made payments and it\u2019s got at least one confirmation on it, it\u2019s impossible to reverse. Demerits: As a merchant, your customer have to wait until the network starts to confirm transaction before the deal could be closed. We all know how this confirmation can take some time based on fee and network congestion which isn\u2019t encouraging for swift business. Also, you can\u2019t afford to make any mistakes with the address and not notice it quick enough to initiate a double spending before confirmation else, your money is just gone. Lower Fees. As mentioned before the fees are much cheaper than Western Unions. Well, that\u2019s depends. I usually don\u2019t find it funny when the network is congested, like it was just over a week ago although, it\u2019s much improved right now but, Fred aren\u2019t cool here and it doesn\u2019t matter if your transacting across boarder or your doing it locally. The fee is just the same, irrespective of the amount involved of course, number of confirmations too. Security. The Bitcoin network has never been hacked. Provided you properly store your private keys your Bitcoin is safe. Although, it\u2019s highly discouraged, when you happen to be holding your funds on an exchange, you could be hacked. When it\u2019s about the network, of course not. That isn\u2019t going to be the case.","435":"Lower Fees. As mentioned before the fees are much cheaper than Western Unions. The transaction fee varies, there factors that are used to calculate the transaction fee of bitcoin, one is the size which is the number of input and output too, the most important factor again is the network congestion, if the network gets congested bitcoin transaction fees goes up as many people will want to get their transactions confirmed faster and that will make it difficult for low fee transactions to be picked. So ideally this days bitcoin isn\u2019t suitable for low amount transactions. Merits: Once you\u2019ve made payments and it\u2019s got at least one confirmation on it, it\u2019s impossible to reverse. This is can be reversed when there is a chain reorg and the transaction gets dropped back to the mempool and the sender actually double spends it to a different address, that\u2019s why the minimum requirement for most exchanges are either 3 or 6 confirmations to avoid a chain re org","436":"Because its volatility, for that purpose, I think USDT or USDC are better than BTC.

It is \"impossible\" for any government or other large entity to control Bitcoin. 2. Bitcoin is \"absolutely safe\" since the redundancy and dispersal of the network makes it impossible to compromise. But as we discussed in another thread here, Satoshi identified, in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, the risk of a \"51% attack\" on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin's integrity is safe, Satoshi said in essence, as long as a majority of the network's hashrate is not \"evil\". Bitcoin's hashrate is controlled by \"miners\", and some of these mining companies are large, publicly traded companies. The question this brings up is this: how hard would it be for some \"evil\" entity--say a major world government or an extremely sophisticated group of hackers--to gain control of the the companies (or key personnel within those companies, or key servers within those companies) that comprise over 51% of the hashrate, and thus take control of Bitcoin? Or in another scenario, how many companies would a large government e.g. the US or the EU need to compel in order to effectively change the Bitcoin network? Here is an article that alleges that just 0.1% of Bitcoin miners control half of all mining capacity. It's a little old, and I would wonder if the hashrate is even more concentrated now, since that's what businesses tend to do: consolidate. Does anybody have any more recent data about this? To me, this seems like a really big deal since it calls the security of the Bitcoin network itself into question. And at minimum, the idea that only a handful of public, not-government-proof, companies actually control Bitcoin sorta... flies in the face of the prevailing Bitcoin mythology .","442":"The 51% rule on the bitcoin network is like a protocol that suggests that if a miner or mining pool is able to attain 51% of the total Bitcoin network's hash rate they will have an edge over the whole network and can dominate blocks more significantly by being able to do certain things like alter more recent blocks and some other stuff. The fact is that the chances of some miner or mining pool pulling a 51% attack is very thin. This is because aside from the fact that attaining such amount of hash power would not be easy, I believe no pool will be soo foolish to waste such huge amount of hash rate to harm a network that they can benefit heavily from with that same hash rate. Every miner is out for profit and pulling such an attack that might even be neutralized would be uneconomical.","443":"The question this brings up is this: how hard would it be for some \"evil\" entity--say a major world government or an extremely sophisticated group of hackers--to gain control of the the companies (or key personnel within those companies, or key servers within those companies) that comprise over 51% of the hashrate, and thus take control of Bitcoin? Or in another scenario, how many companies would a large government e.g. the US or the EU need to compel in order to effectively change the Bitcoin network? With the current hashrate percentage, as you asked the government will only get to hold onto just two pools; foundary USA (26.67% hashrate) and Antpool (25.38% hashrate) to make it a 51% hashrate. There is more because the government will need to actually generate large electricity again to be able to continue mining without the other miners getting a block. Also one thing we have failed to understand about 51% attack or double spending is that the Miner with this hash power wouldn\u2019t still be able to use it get in invalid transactions in, other nodes will need to accept the transactions first. Having an invalid transaction like you think will just nullify the work done by the mining pool and also means they lost energy. But overall this will be very bad for the network as they could even censor some transactions that they will include in their blocks and you will have to wait till the smaller miners get to mine a block and add your transaction","444":"Performing a 51% attack on the network will be a very tough task considering the things that must be involved. A 51% attack will require the performer to have control over at least 51% of the total computing power (hash rate). This attack would cost so much since the computing power will require more powerful hardware and consume more energy. But we should also understand that the more the network grows with more people on board, the more secure Bitcoin becomes, making 51% attack more difficult to perform. which means, as more adoptors, Bitcoin price, mining difficulty,etc continue to increase, then the network security also increase. I think this increment should be in a linear pattern (correct me if am wrong). 1. It is \"impossible\" for any government or other large entity to control Bitcoin. I think most government or entity might have thought of this idea, but ended up dumping it due to the imaginable cost attached to performing such attack.","445":"mining \"control\" is just the risk of empty blocks, chain re-orgs to double spend its not about \"controlling bitcoin\" in regards to changing the rules most mining pools are not some building with servers which a swat team can invade.. instead its just some ip address of some cloud service which a mining pool brand has multiple IP addresses and cloud services set up for dotted around the planet (remote location stratums) if an entity took over a server they cant change the rules as their blocks would get rejected. so all they can mess with is the amount of transactions they include or if enough power over enough time go back and change the transaction list of a recent old block and then catch up to re-org the chain of recent blocks to undo some confirmed transactions if an entity took over a mining pool server. miners can simply 'pool hop' away to another mining pool or even just a different stratum ip address of same brand if they notice silliness occur to blocks produced by a certain pool however everyone has become too reliant on cores code releases and follow blindly out of \"trust\" even when new releases do change the rules of what data it put into blocks, but do not benefit bitcoiners.. and instead benefit the inception of the idea that bitcoiners should stop transacting on bitcoin and use other networks for their daily activity, to allow spammers and metadata bloaters to fill blocks for high fee's to further annoy bitcoiners the real \"control bitcoin\" in regards to the rules ends up being more related to majority following cores code. and core being controlled by under a dozen devs with code force-merge privileges all employed by just 3 companies who get funded by certain institutions\/organisations","446":"This has been discussed over and over again. And I think there is consistency in the assurance that, though this is a possibility, this is far from happening. For one, an attacker needs \"between $5 billion and $20 billion\" to be able to attempt such attack.[1] Second, there is not much you can gain from it. If you wish to make money, it would be way more profitable for you to use your resources to support the network rather than to attack it. On the other hand, if you wish to just bring Bitcoin down, it wouldn't work either. With your $5 billion to $20 billion, all you can do is attack the network for a little while. Neither can you totally control the network nor sustain the attack.

The attack would not entail one lone miner, but rather many miners in a coordinated attack\/government order. 2. There would be no incremental cost for such a move since these are companies that already have the servers in place and are mining for the network every single day. The challenge here is convincing\/forcing\/tricking a smaller number of companies to do something, not duplicate what they are doing already. With the current hashrate percentage, as you asked the government will only get to hold onto just two pools; foundary USA (26.67% hashrate) and Antpool (25.38% hashrate) to make it a 51% hashrate. So... there are two public companies in the world that control over half of the Bitcoin network. Okay. So much for being \"decentralized\" . Seriously, what is to stop the USA\/EU\/some other country from simply ordering these two companies to change Bitcoin's central software in order to make it do different things e.g. give Satoshi's blocks to charity? One other thing that keeps coming up here is the notion that \"somebody\" could reject the participation of miners who are, upon deep analysis, breaking the rules. Who enforces that rules? How? I get that any of us here could simply do our own calculations, but what would be the exact mechanism wherein the network, without any central authority whatsoever, would \"reject\" this software change? Perhaps I have my answer below? so all they can mess with is the amount of transactions they include or if enough power over enough time go back and change the transaction list of a recent old block and then catch up to re-org the chain of recent blocks to undo some confirmed transactions Um, that sounds like... total control of Bitcoin to me . Seriously, if I could double-spend and validate blocks without the private key, that's... absolute control of the network, at least in terms of Bitcoin's actual function. Quote if an entity took over a mining pool server. miners can simply 'pool hop' away to another mining pool or even just a different stratum ip address of same brand if they notice silliness occur to blocks produced by a certain pool How would you know which is which on the fly? And what is to stop the majority hashrate from doing it's own \"pool hopping\" or for that matter any individual miner today? If users of the network can simply pick and choose the nodes they will and won't work with, then that means a 51% attack is even easier since the \"good\" nodes would be instantly iced out and deemed \"evil\" by the \"evil\" nodes. And if you are talking about doing things based on ip addresses, then boy oh boy, there are lots and lots of problems with that. IP addresses can change in milliseconds, there are many ways to change\/cloak them, and so on. No serious secure system on the public Internet uses ip addresses as a mechanism for identity. So question is, how would one stop a 51% attack? From my understand of the network, a \"51% attack\" would immediately turn into a \"49% attack\" by the losing minority, and the \"good\" nodes would be treated as the \"evil\" ones.","448":"1.

I find it pretty crazy that the US Congress was able to construct such a law on such a specific and complicated technology. (Of course there would be no \"monopoly\" necessary here since all that is required is 51%).

This is why you are already getting false information here about Foundry USA and Antpool that leads you to the false conclusion \"two public companies in the world that control over half of the Bitcoin network\". These companies do NOT control the entire said percentage of hashrate. They are mining pools that actual miners with actual hashrate connect to. The hashrate in their own control is less. That means if the pool turns malicious, miners would migrate and that percentage would fall. Also keep in mind that in order for an entity to perform a 51% attack they will have to have actual control over the mining equipment. Meaning the said government has to kick down doors and send SWAT teams to physically seize people's ASICs from their homes (the solo home miners) or from the companies (farms) to be able to first control that much ASIC then provide the infrastructure to install and start mining (ie. massive location, electricity, cooling, staff, etc). That's because no miner in their right mind would ever participate in an attack against something they are making a profit from because the moment that attack takes place, their revenue would head toward zero. So they either migrate their business elsewhere (offshoring) or just shut down and enjoy whatever bitcoin they already have. Quote Here is an article that alleges that just 0.1% of Bitcoin miners control half of all mining capacity. I'm not familiar with NBER works but I skimmed through the 55 page they published and I have to say that's an interesting effort but I still don't like their methodology and the logic they used like the following: \"The idea is that miners in a particular region would most likely send their rewards to an exchange that is also in this region.\" This is a weak logic at best that makes their conclusion unreliable as well. https:\/\/www.nber.org\/system\/files\/working_papers\/w29396\/w29396.pdf In any case we should be concerned about centralization creeping in at all times. But I wouldn't make any conclusions on whether things are already centralized or not. One of the biggest hits on decentralization of mining was when China shut down mining in its territory, forcing them to migrate elsewhere increasing the hashrate concentration elsewhere. We needed this kind of diversification so that if one independent \"bloc\" went crazy the rest remain sane.","452":"They can't do that anyway, that's because there's a regulations about this and when they reach that, they will have no choice to split up again right so the 51% isn't a possibility.

Every single person I've ever talked to in person who holds Bitcoin does so through a broker or an app. Anecdotal, I know, but it sure seems like a remarkable coincidence. Quote 95% crash is debatable but they can definitely crash the market with a ban. However, it won't be because people use it in a centralized way. It would be because if dozens of countries suddenly banned bitcoin, people would start panic selling it which would crash bitcoin. Something that would still happen even if not a single centralized exchange (or any other centralized service) existed. If no centralized exchanges existed, and nobody could buy Bitcoin through straight-forward means, I suspect Bitcoin would still be a dollar. Most average consumers don't want to go to all of that trouble.","460":"Brands? Huh?

If Bitcoin is legal in your country, then proceeds from Bitcoin investment sales is a good reason for the sum you would be receiving into your account.

Remember to document the txid from when you bought Bitcoin and when you sold. About tax authorities you may need to speak to an advisor who will guide you on how to fill your tax report. Tax laws vary from country to country and even within states in the same country so you'll need to have accurate information on your tax obligations and possible loopholes that allow you spend less.","472":"If you want to do that, my advice is to process wd to fiat with an amount that is not too noticeable and if at the same time it is not impossible that the bank will ask about all of it with a note to you.

If our people are ordinary people with ordinary account activities, it will be very strange if once money enters our account immediately fat, for example 1 BTC directly. That's pretty big.

It's through that there're certain amount of monetary transactions that may occur in a bank account which could attract the attention of the banks management. Literally it's usually huge amount of money that may have not been a usual to that very bank account. This is a very critical issue but some of us may not know about it. I've heard of so many bank accounts being frozen by the authority because a transaction made of it seems strange and suspicious. So while some governments are being against bitcoin, it's a risk of Investors to sell such huge amount of bitcoin and get the money sent to their bank accounts because it could trigger monitoring of the account which the investors would be questioned. And in such case, the Investor could be in trouble. So Op, if the government isn't against bitcoin, I don't think if it'd be a problem if you tell the bank the source where the money came from while the clue to escape that questionable fact by the bank is for the Investor to trade the amount of the huge bitcoin sequentially without running the transaction at a one spot.","480":"Hello,friends The question is more for those who once converted a lot of bitcoins into fiat to their bank accounts How did you do it so that the tax authorities and the bank manager would not question where the money came from? I think the answer to this question should vary from one county to another, because here in Nigeria, bank accounts are sub divided into more than 3 categories, that is; 1. A kid's bank account, which could accumulate a highest amount from. #10 to #100,000 Naira, with a daily transaction limit of #10,000. 2. A teenager's bank account, which could afford amount from #100,000 to #1million Naira, and lastly 3. An adult or business bank account, which could accumulate from #1million and above (i.e unlimited). So if by mistake you happen to send money to either a kid or teenager's bank account which has limitations of a certain amount it's likely to accumulate, then in that scenario, you are likely to be asked to come do account upgrade. Which is why here, it's always good to send huge sum of money to these business or corporate bank account. So as to avoid bank managers questioning where the money came from.

Rather than market conditions I should say political conditions. Like the dollar is being effected by the Middle east block and trades are being shifted from dollar to other currencies this is not a small event. If this continues then we should not expect BTC to pump rather if it remain on its position it would be a miracle. I think by now every Bitcoin enthusiast or potential investor has one form of wallet or the other and am sure an individual can have up to three exchange platforms as well, without any cause for alarm. New wallets are created for many reasons and it might include investment reasons. I know that one requirement for an ETF investor is that own a brokerage account. You'll need a brokerage account instead of a wallet inorder to buy, sell and hold BTC ETFs.","498":"This makes sense as Bitcoin is mostly used as an investment now, and thus individuals don't actually hold Bitcoin in the technical sense, they merely hold an entry in some broker's database saying they do. This is what Gary Gensler meant when he recently said that Bitcoin is, for most users of it these days, not decentralized. It's just another investment instrument. What we're learning here is that Bitcoin is popular because most people like meme investments, not because of the hype around it being \"decentralized\".","499":"Price-wise it is OK to be bullish because bitcoin is a deflationary asset but adoption-wise, it is kind of concerning. We have already seen Litecoin beating Bitcoin on bitpay stats and that happened 5 months consecutively. I don't think the stats for May will be much different. People simply don't use bitcoin for payments anymore and it is not people's fault, they simply can't use it because of the high fees and that's why they are using something else. In this situation, it happens to be litecoin. https:\/\/bitpay.com\/stats\/ Maybe it is better this way. If people want to make payments, they can choose an alt and there are no shortage of good, cheap & fast altcoins. Litecoin, Dogecoin, XMR and even bcash is not that bad if you want to pay cheap tx fees. People who want to get digital gold, they'll get bitcoin.","500":"Everyone is beginning to be bearish hehehehe Who exactly is bearish?? lol I think the only people who would be bearish on Bitcoin right now are people who don't know anything about Bitcoin.

The general knowledge of an average crypto investor has continuously increased as well over time, with more people knowing about what bitcoin is and cryptocurrency in general than someone, say, from 2012, so it's no surprise that a lot of these new bloods gonna get their hands not on bitcoin, but on other cryptocurrencies. It also has to be said that bitcoin's reached a status and price point that discourages the uninformed to invest in it at all. The average schmuck will think it's over for them and they can't invest in bitcoin anymore since it's already that expensive, when they could, and bitcoin could very well increase in value even more in the future. These are just some inferences and hypotheses I have surrounding this apparent decline in people's interest over bitcoin.","502":"Six months ago, excitement around spot Bitcoin ETFs, developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem such as Ordinals, and the upcoming halving drove the average weekly number of new Bitcoin addresses to approach its highest levels since its all-time high value in December 2017. I guess the part where you're interchanging Bitcoin wallet address to meaning same thing as Bitcoin wallet goes to show the lack of basic knowledge on the part of the blog that did this analysis and his inability to getting fact straight before concluding on such analysis. But that being said, if we're considering the possible reasons behind a possible reduction in the numbers of new persons that are joining the Bitcoin network and creating new Bitcoin address after the development of the Bitcoin spot ETF and and the the whole halving event, it's either one of the following reasons. 1. Most newbies that are joining the Bitcoin ecosystem in general are mostly driven into the system by hypes mostly from those that are already in the system and I guess that's why we had a lot of new persons that even joined the forum as the halving approaches because they would normally want to benefit from the whole post halving bull and I guess that is what also played out during the development of the Bitcoin spot ETF. 2. Others might just be investing into different meme coin hoping that the much anticipated bull will affect the price of meme coin drastically. Like in my region, what's now trending is airdrops and a lot of new folks that have little knowledge on crypto are delving all in because they are mostly in search of quick gains. Yet six months on, just like in early 2018, the number of new addresses joining the network has cratered as the fervor around new Bitcoin projects dies down. it's not as though Bitcoin address is what you create everyday right? If the analysis is true that prio to the Bitcoin spot ETF, lots of address where created and that in anticipation of the halving, it also helped increase the number of people that are joining the network, it only goes to show that most of those joining the network are short termed driven folks that only come in when they see a potential profit and reducing there actively when there willed expectations doesn't come through in the shortest possible time. It's not even about the numbers of new address that we have in the system that determines if Bitcoin is on the bullish side of not, new Bitcoin members reality don't even have that good chunk of holding in Thier wallet and so regardless of thier numbers, it's not a serious factor that plays any big role in determining how bullish ot how bearish Bitcoin is .","503":"No content","504":"Bitcoin: 93% premine to anyone born today. 100% premine to anyone born in 2140.

The wasted electricity is the problem of the energy sector, they should have a solution to that problem a long time ago not bitcoin. 51% attack is difficult to do because there are a lot of people that's not connected to each other so it's difficult to gather nodes to be able to do that, not to mention that it's economically impractical for someone to do that anyways.","509":"Some on your list may be true, some may be not.

But don't be surprised when people who believe bitcoin is the best can build a luxurious house for their child someday with just a few bitcoins.

That is a problem with technology in general. Fiat can buy all the miners and coins, Central bankers still win. Do you think the central bankers will waste all of their money to: 1. Buy all of the ASICs from all of the miners (coins do not count because you cannot manipulate blocks using coins in proof of work). 2. Buy up as many warehouses as necessary to host them with proper heating and cooling (billions more dollars) 2. Replicate 14 years worth of block history which will likely cost even more billions of dollars to electricity companies?

And if some tools came along which are obviously going to be third parties as current tools mostly in use are open source and I don't want to use close source one so in short tools should be open source and verified. If any tool came into being that will make mining a little easier like in terms of implementation of things then I will like that more and will become a miner myself with the little funds I have.

Why do people complain about user-friendliness? We have smooth user interfaces. The user-friendliness that i meant has nothing to do with the design and user interface of the wallet, but with its possible correlation with other altcoins in a simplified ecosystem for any user, what I mean is that it is as simple as you make a transaction to x person in any cyptocurrency having only ''a one wallet address or their email, user etc...''. Something that would correlate all crypto systems in a simplified environment as easy to use for any user and from my point of view would help more in its growth, and I'm not talking about my ass in this case.","543":"I can think of 3 things which will help bitcoin to grow - 1. User friendly wallet that calculates transaction fees and gives you options to choose the fees. 2. Scale to accommodate larger volume of transaction. With global adoption, the volume of transaction is expected to increase. Bitcoin network really needs to scale up. 3. Completely ban BRC20 tokens and fix the gap so that these nonsenses do not show up again.

But even without having someone to teach them personally and real time, as long as they're able to follow step by step, that means that they're user friendly and easy to use. I get your point here and I'd probably focus on the more part if you're not satisfied with the existing ones.

Let's assume '~' corresponds to 'e' and 'E' corresponds to 't' based on their frequency. Exploit Letter Patterns: Look for repeated letter patterns or common words in the ciphertext that might correspond to known words in the plaintext. Cross-reference and Refine: Align the words from S1 with the lines of C1 and check if any letter mappings create recognizable words. Refine mappings based on emerging patterns and formed words. Fill the Gaps: Use partially deciphered parts of C1 to guess remaining letters based on context and surrounding letters.

Upon further analysis and refinement, the derived substitution rule may be refined to accurately map each plaintext character to its corresponding ciphertext character based on the given CipherCard. Once the substitution rule is determined, it can be applied to the entire ciphertext to decrypt it and obtain the original plaintext. This process requires careful observation, analysis, and iteration to ensure the accuracy of the derived rule and the resulting decryption.

Have fun solving the puzzle, and, well, good luck!","562":"Interesting! A few blocks before the halving, and I was thinking of grabbing a snack, chilling and watching the countdown. But, let's solve a puzzle! I have never solved a \"reverse deduction puzzle\" or even \"cipher problem\", so I'm already in a disadvantageous position. I can see from the short ciphertext that each cipher-word is 6-letter long, which must be important. I've been looking the card combinations for quite a lot of time, though. No ideas.","563":"Thanks for the quote, I'm a de facto newbie here, although I've been in the industry for many years. Later on I'll briefly tell a little story about why I started this challenge, which doesn't directly help solve the puzzle, but it allows one to cut through it in a different way. Full quote below for the purpose of making the pictures better visible as OP is still a newbie but maybe not for a long time. Nice challenge and puzzle by the way.

No, in fact, these letters contain more information, and as we all know, to record the BIP39 seed phrases, it's enough to record the first 4 letters of each seed word, so we have room to cram in more information that is necessary to perform substitution encryption. It's not really hard to derive backwards, the point is to understand the process of going forwards. Happy hunting Interesting!

These passwords are used to sign up for various websites or services, and that's odd, I never thought of saving seed phrases in this way (considering I've been into bitcoin mining for 13 years now). A chance encounter made me want to share my approach to password management, and I've even written an article about this approach, which I call the \"Rule-Based Multi-Table Substitution Strong Password Management Method and Tool\". In that article I compare the password management tools available on the market and give a lot of examples to illustrate what the \"rule-based\" approach is. I claimed that the security of passwords depends on the security of the rules, not the substitution tables. Even if the information on the PassCard is made public, it still doesn't compromise the security of all my passwords, and even if it is coupled with one password compromised by a phishing attack, it doesn't compromise the security of other passwords with the same rules and the same substitution table. I realize I may have blown it a bit. Using it myself is one scenario, and letting more people use it is another, the attack exposure increases so many times that I need to perform a more extensive security validation for the sake of prudence, but haven't been able to come up with a proper test plan. Just about 1 month ago, I happened to see Asanoha's nostr post on the Seed Cipher, which I think is a tool\/artifact related to seed phrase encryption, and he then launched a Puzzle challenge. By the way, that was a brute force cracking challenge that still has no challenger declared successful, anyone interested can learn about it from this link. That inspired me, but there are still some differences between passwords and seed words, at the most basic level, (BIP39) seed words are limited to a 2048 word dictionary, and even including SLIP39 and Electrum, there are only 3210 selectable words, which makes brute force cracking considerably less difficult. In order to make rule-based multi-table substitution encryption work for seed words, I've made a simple upgrade to the CipherCard, which makes the two cards you just saw very different from the stainless steel one I had in my poket, and a new set of two cards (laser-cut + laser-engraved) is being customized to be received very soon, I think. So I decided to put up 0.1 BTC to start this challenge, I'm not sure if that reward is attractive enough, after all there are hundreds of BTC worth of challenges out there. Let's see, maybe I'll pump more prizes into the pool, maybe someone else will offer a sponsorship to the pool, maybe this challenge will only survive for a week or two before it's cracked, who knows? I just hope this challenge lasts a little longer, because I need time to update my article, add chapter about seed phrases, and also replace the pictures in the article with pictures of the new CipherCard so that all the examples I've given will need to be rewritten based on the new CipherCard as well. As I said, security depends on the rules, not the information on the card, and even if this challenge is solved, it only means that the rules I set were too simple, and maybe I'll re-initiate a more difficult challenge with more complex rules while offering higher prizes, who knows? If luck isn't on the challenger's side, I think I'll offer to end the game at some point, reveal the real method, share the revised and finished article to make this kind of method available to everyone for free, And maybe a little extra bonus for some of the active challengers\/sponsors, who knows?","567":"Yes, I will of course follow up with some tips one by one, as I said earlier, the reverse derivation is not difficult, the point is to understand the forward process. I just wrote a paragraph to explain why this puzzle challenge exists. This card was originally designed as a multi-table substitution encryption for generating multiple high-strength passwords, initially as a one-to-two mapping. But that's not safe enough if it's going to be used for seed phrases, so this time I've upgraded to a set of two cards, and as you can see, for each index letter, that now translates to four possible substitutions, which is a one-to-four multi-table substitution. Think about it differently, what would you do if you were the one using such a one-to-four multi-table substitute encryption? Would you leave yourself a hint: in what way should these two cards be placed? And in what order to use the four substitution tables once they've been placed? The imgs are very complicated because you tell us more than one image \ud83d\ude15 can you write something or tell something \ud83e\udd14","568":"The real puzzle is to understand the puzzle. Not a good puzzle if it needs so much explaination imho. Good look everyone. I skip.","569":"Are you French ??","570":"In fact the puzzle is as simple as it is literally and needs no additional explanation. You got plaintext, you got ciphertext, you got substitution table, and then you backpropagate from another ciphertext to another plaintext, and now you have two plaintexts, and you're the winner. But not everyone here can figure out multisig wallets and BIP39, I guess. So what's the harm in writing more? The real puzzle is to understand the puzzle. Not a good puzzle if it needs so much explaination imho. Good look everyone. I skip.","571":"Me I have one problem I can understand everything but I have problem with the 6 card it's hard to find a pattern I try many time but I need to now the first word and why U equal A AND ALSO U equal e whyyy","572":"Not necessarily, and the seed phrase here, surely, is in English. Are you French ??","573":"No, in fact, these letters contain more information, and as we all know, to record the BIP39 seed phrases, it's enough to record the first 4 letters of each seed word, so we have room to cram in more information that is necessary to perform substitution encryption. Not entirely sure what you mean in here. Yes, it is enough if we have the first four letters of a word, because they are unique. So, we have more room to introduce information that will obscure these letters? For example, could URU\/Yw be \"aren\" followed by another input that is used in your rule to help us go figure out the next word? I've been looking at it since yesterday, but it's a loss of time until this point. We know absolutely nothing about your rule. It could be anything, like take the first cipher-letter ('U') and use it to find potential letters that it points given a combination using the silver and black cards (e.g., from the first of the twelve combinations, it points to 'h', 'j', 'n' and 'm'). That's just one of the nearly infinite rules I can think of. I checked an account under the nostr post you shared, from BitCat, which I presumes is yours, because they're describing a very similar patent of securing passwords. As far as I can tell, it's infeasible to achieve reversal; our only hope is that you've used a \"simple\" rule, which could be utterly subjective.","574":"No content","575":"I was just browsing around the economics section, and again full of de-dollarization, the dollar is dying, bla bla, I was curious what are the people who hate the dollar that much using instead.

And when I say you know, I mean by heart, not making the exchange math in your mind, one BTC is 70k , 1 Euro is 1.1 USD so then, or something like this!

What happens is that if the price of Bitcoin in dollars goes down, or if you prefer, if Bitcoin loses purchasing power, the payment in Bitcoins is the same, so the company actually saves money. And if the Bitcoin price goes up, the rates are adjusted. The only one that endured for a long time without doing this was CM, until it was a scandalous thing, there were jealous people who started to protest and CM ended up paying in dollar equivalence. I am not saying this because of those two in specific, it is what usually happens. So if obviously everyone is still even around here pricing everything in USD, at least in private, do you know the price of one BTC in any other currency than the USD and your own? I sometimes look at it in Euros, but mostly in US Dollars. As we have discussed in other threads, the dollar is a depreciating currency, but most of the ones that try to compete against it are much worse. It is still the world's reference currency and the safe haven currency no matter how much people try to say otherwise. Sure it is not as strong as it was 30 years ago but it is nowhere near as bad as it is being portrayed.","577":"(...)So if obviously everyone is still even around here pricing everything in USD, at least in private, do you know the price of one BTC in any other currency than the USD and your own?

Yep, as you mentioned about stablecoins, I suddenly realized that I also have to use USD as the unit to calculate even if I later convert it to fiat form. But I'm not sure because when looking back on binance there is still a lot of liquidity for other stablecoinsmaybe they are not popular or updated on cmc, cgk,... because they are only based on management from the existing platform.","578":"It's obvious for most people to evaluate global\/international stuffs in USD equivalent, it's why USD is really hard to be overtaken by other currency. USD is one of many strong fiat out there, even though it's depreciated i.e. the value decrease overtime, but people still trust it. People who live in third world countries didn't hate USD, instead they choose to invest in USD because their local currency is worse than USD. People who live in first world countries hate USD because they have plenty choice investment that growth better than just hand their money on banks.","579":"So if obviously everyone is still even around here pricing everything in USD, at least in private, do you know the price of one BTC in any other currency than the USD and your own? 1 BTC = 1 Tesla Model X Double-checking this only seems to apply for the US market though. Also cars arguably don't count as currency. I roughly know the BTC prices of various digital services, but these are super blurry because they keep changing all the time due to being USD and EUR-denominated so they are hard to remember.","580":"USD is our reserve currency for the entire world. There are many reasons that constituent to why USD has been chosen to be the reserve currency but a few of them would be its strong economy and their demographic. Even though it is the reserve currency, it is not in fact the strongest currency in the world. Anyway the reason why most people use USD as the \u201cdefault\u201d currency is because it is the reserve currency and it is easier to concert x to usd or usd from x. This still shows the impact of USD to the financial system.","581":"BRICS misson is to looking for ways many countries (especially China and Russia etc) will not depend on United States dollars so that they will be able to make US sanction not to have much effect. They are still on it but dollar remains the dominant currency. United States dollars remain the most traded currency even till now and it makes up almost 88% in total in 2023, just as it was since many years ago. The highest among the reserve currencies is also still the United States dollars. It account for $58.41 in 2023. https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reserve_currency How about bitcoin pair with fiat?

Participants or guests can use fiat currency converters to convert $ to other fiat currency or to gold, silver. I think I understood what you want but it will cause to inconvenience for some related entities (company, manager, participant). Some campaigns have their pay rate directly in BTC but some others want to have a fix pay rate in $, then convert it to BTC for payment. I guess companies and managers have reasons for this choice, convenience. De-dollarization is not in their mind.","583":"Talking about de-dollarization was possible during the Petrodollars in 70s and 80s of the last century, when economies began to grow and countries wanted to rise. It was possible for the dollar to be replaced, but the dollar is currently permeated in economies and the attempt to replace it came too late. What happened with Russia made many countries afraid, so alliances like BRICS are realistic and will expand, but they will not change the fact that the dollar will not be replaced except by a world war.","584":"USD and my local currency PHP(Philippines Peso) is what I\u2019m using to convert Bitcoin price but mainly USD since I just multiply the price of Bitcoin in USD by 55 to get the approximately value in PHP. USD is the currency which is always the default currency of site like coinmarketcap and coingecko but there\u2019s a feature under the hamburger tab to change the default currency to the currency that you preferred. Even in language we are using US English language as common language here in the forum. US sets everything as global default.","585":"Well firstly, to answer the question of the topic, I kinda have a range estimate for Bitcoin price in my local currency which is naira. However the problem is even when it comes to value fluctuation USD is a better currency at keeping a stable rate compared to Naira. In fact Nigerian naira is so volatile that almost a 100% of major exchanges online especially import and export are based on the dollar. Therefore it's almost unimportant to keep updated on the price of Bitcoin straight to Naira, instead most persons take not of the Bitcoin to Dollar price and then they can make use of the dollar to naira since it's quite easier that way. The undoubtable fact is that a great percentage of the world's exchanges are done using an estimation of dollar price or value. This is mainly because of political dominance and the overall size of the US economy compared to many others. However although USD is quite stable, others like Kuwaiti dinar and Gibraltar pound are more stable although they are used in almost no global exchanges.","586":"I think I understood what you want but it will cause to inconvenience for some related entities (company, manager, participant).

That's one funny thing when I go outside the Eurozone but still in the EU, everyone knows the prices of more expensive things in euros, houses, cars, everything, but when it comes to Bitcoin they all quote the price in $, probably the only stuff that they know the price in USD. Funny but also pretty weird! I think stompix is kind of relating it to BRICS and how people are saying BRICS mission could be fulfilled. You mistyped \"making fun of\" in that sentence! Cause you know it's quite funny to hear people preaching about the death of the dollar and then joining a signature that basically pays in $. I keep wondering why nobody is offering payments in Iranian rials or Indian rupees! However although USD is quite stable, others like Kuwaiti dinar and Gibraltar pound are more stable although they are used in almost no global exchanges. The Kuwaiti dollar is pegged to a basket of currencies, the euro and the USD have the largest share so you can't call it being more stable than.

The best way to store your seeds phrase is to write them down and save them in a place that you are the only one that have access to such place in case anything happen to your system or phone, your coins in your wallet will not be harm since you still have the seeds phrase to restore them back and continue having access to them.

Honestly, in my first years or early days of my crypto journey, I only typed my seed phrase in a notepad on my computer and let it sit there, but luckily I didn't encounter someone who hacked my computer and accessed my passwords and seed phrase. But maybe because I have knowledge when it comes to technology and the internet, I know what to avoid and what to do to secure my properties. Remember, if you are storing your seed phrase on the internet, like Google Drive or cloud storage, then stop it immediately because hackers could easily access it. But if you are storing your seed phrase on your device only or on a computer, remember to encrypt your files containing seed phrases and don't access malicious websites because there are places where you can get malware that could access your device and steal what it can.","607":"What mistakes did you make, and what advice do you have for others to be careful?

As long as you always store them offline, never store your seed phrases on an online platform. Another thing is to always have 2 to 3 backups and store them in various safe locations so that in case one of them is lost, we still have access to our bitcoins. For me, I write my seed phrase in a notebook and have 2 more copies stored in different places and of course they are all safe.","608":"I haven't lost my seed phrase before, but I am very much aware of the danger that comes with careless storage of seed phrase and one the ways that one can have issues with seed phrase storage is by not making a hard copy and storing it offline and in different places. Also storing your seed phrase online which is at risk of getting hacked into by thieves, we have always been warned against making such mistakes, off storing them online such as in our email draft and the rest of the other online storage, this is why, it is very important to have a well-informed mindset before you even set out to open a wallet.","609":"So far, I haven't made a mistake in losing the seed or private key of Bitcoin. Does this include the wasted Bitcoin from participating in doublers and HYIP sites before? That would probably be more embarrassing to think about now. The best way to secure Bitcoin, especially if it has a significant value, is to have a hardware wallet. Never store your seed online. What I do is I simply write down all my seeds in a notebook that only I know about.","610":"What mistakes did you make, and what advice do you have for others to be careful? I have not lost my seed phrase before. The seed phrase is the money because it is what I need to spend my coins, so I can not lose it or it would be very difficult for me to lose. What are the best and worst ways of storing a seed in your opinion? Storing seed phrase on phone is not good because your phone can be compromised with malware Storing it on Google cloud, iCloud and other online cloud is not good. It can be hacked. There are real life examples. Storing your seed online generally is bad Storing your seed phrase where people can see it is not good Store your seed phrase offline Store it on paper, laminated paper, steel or titanium sheet. Do not use aluminum. Have like two or three copies. You can use passphrase with it but store separately in different locations. If you lose either your seed phrase or passphrase, you will lose your coins. Think about natural disaster and if it happens, how you will not lose your seed phrase","611":"You can use passphrase with it but store separately in different locations. If you lose either your seed phrase or passphrase, you lose your coins. Think about natural disaster and if it happens, how you will not lose your seed phrase When I saw the various natural disasters that happened last year, I realised the importance of storing seed phrases in waterproof and fireproof materials. Another important condition is to save the seed phrase in locations that are far from each other. The earthquake in Turkey, Syria and Morroco affected large cities, while the Libyan flood destroyed the coastal city of Derna. It might be good to store your seed phrase in different locations if possible different cities because of large-scale natural disasters. The best way to secure Bitcoin, especially if it has a significant value, is to have a hardware wallet. Never store your seed online. What I do is I simply write down all my seeds in a notebook that only I know about. A notebook might not be appropriate especially if the wallet holds large funds because it can be easily destroyed. Waterproof and fireproof materials will be a better option in case of emergencies.","612":"I have never lost access to my recovery seed before, I always write them down in a book and no single natural disasters have made me lose them, I have lost my bitcoin before but that's me importing the recovery seed into a bad\/fake Bitcoin wallet and I got drained. Writing down your recovery seed is a safe method if you can keep the book safe, but I recommend multiple recovery backup, just in case, you only have to make sure it's back up offline, you can write it down in two separate locations and keep your mouth shut about it. Avoid taking screenshot of your recovery seed, do not store them in any online cloud storage, if possible you should get a hardware wallet, they are always safer than software wallet, make sure the bitcoin wallet you are using is fully open-source like Electrum.","613":"What mistakes did you make, and what advice do you have for others to be careful? What are the best and worst ways of storing a seed in your opinion? I am not just that careless person unless I do not have an interest in a thing. But I must say that I'd lost access to my wallets, not even once, but the good thing is that I do not have money in any of them, which could also be responsible for the careless handling. The first one I lost access to was the one I forgot my password and also lost the seedphrase. That was around 2014, I never took it seriously. But recently, I made a terrible mistake, still, I do not have money in my wallet, if not, it would have been disastrous. I got to know of an issue when I wanted to move money to the wallet. As a smart person, I first uninstalled the app and reinstalled it to be sure of the seed phrases, it was then I discovered that I copied the wrong seed phrases. I later went back to the registration page of the app to find what was wrong, and that was how I discovered that the pattern was not as usual as I thought. The style was confusing, so I copied the right words but in the wrong arrangement. Thank God I've never sent money into it. As for the best ways to keep the seed phrase, I don't think there is a better way than to write it down manually and also duplicate it. But ensure that you keep them in separate places. I also like to code one word out of the words there to make it more secure in case an uninvited eye sees it. However, I think the worst way to keep it is to save it on your gadgets.","614":"The only ones I've ever had had my computer crash and couldn't recover the data, but luckily those were only addresses that no longer had bitcoins. Participating in this forum has helped me learn a lot of ways to protect personal assets. I have also heard about some storage services but the way I learned is to keep it in a place where only the original copies are kept you can only open. Like many cases that I have seen, they said they wrote down the seed phrase on paper, got a tattoo,... and in the end they still got it stolen or couldn't remember where the things were kept.","615":"Probably all the best ways to store seed phrases have already been described, starting with laminated paper with a recording of the seed phrase, a flash drive, and ending with a capsule from a Ledger with a fairly decent price. But I want to tell one story where more than 1000 bitcoins were received as a bribe, and the owner of these bitcoins was, of course, caught because he was engaged in activities that violated the law, but the fact that he stored his seed phrase on his computer shows how foolish storage locations can be, especially for such a large amount. https:\/\/www.cryptopolitan.com\/russian-accused-of-taking-bribes-in-bitcoin\/","616":"No content","617":"Hello folks, for personal use I developed a Telegram bot that notifies in a Telegram channel the changes of Bitcoin Core fee estimation.

I guess the only time I read about them selling was two years ago, when they sold their bitcoins for the first time. Most people rated that act as a means of avoiding tax because they sold at a low price compared to their purchasing price and bought back immediately after a few days. Selling now will definitely look like they are losing some profit that could have been achieved when bitcoin broke ATH. They are a big organisation with a lot of funds, and they have a target to meet. That's what makes them different from individual investors. They are buying when they feel like the company has enough money to invest in bitcoin. If it was a personal holding, once's Bitcoin breaks new ATH, even if I don't sell, all part of that holding will be sold, and profit for that will be realised first. Why do I wait for pullback? I didn't buy those bitcoins to sit in my wallet as decorations, but they have different purposes, and making profit is part of that purpose.","635":"As of 3\/18\/24, $MSTR holds 214,246 $BTC acquired for ~$7.53B at an average price of $35,160 per bitcoin.

How long would you HODL if you were in MicroStrategy's position? Actually, before anyone buys Bitcoin, they already have it in their minds for the speculated price they want to sell their Bitcoin, and if perhaps the speculated price has not been reached based on their expectations, then they will not sell until they have actually gained the desired profit they expected. If an investor happens to buy Bitcoin at a high price, let's say $70k per Bitcoin, and now the price has dipped to $63k+, the investor will have to hold until the Bitcoin price spikes again and goes above their bought price. These are the reasons why we always remind ourselves to invest the amount we can hold for a long time, so that even when the price drops below the purchased price, the person will have to keep holding until the price begins to surge again. Based on your question, if I am in such a position, I will have to hold my bitcoin until I can achieve the desired profit I was expecting. Speaking of an ATH soon, if you look at the price history of Bitcoin during halving season, the peak price of Bitcoin is usually met a year after the halving has occurred. The bull market is not yet over, so there is a very high chance that we are expecting a new ATH sooner or later next year. Bitcoin is predicted to surge above $100k, and if that happens, those who still bought around $67k will be in profit. There's nothing to worry about.","636":"I am not surprised that they actually DCA at this dip again. On the 14th march 2023 they had actually announced that they have a note of offering of $500M with the pay back been set at for 2031.

With a whopping 214k bitcoin that official makes The company a 1% holder of the current circulation of bitcoin (19.7M) and an unrealized profit of around $8B, it\u2019s actually going on well for them. Do you think it is the correct strategy to buy more BTC and HODL? They did try to buy the dip but it has dipped further. Will we see another ATH soon? How long would you HODL if you were in MicroStrategy's position? Yes it\u2019s the right strategy if you have long term plans. Also we already have an ATH $73k plus and I see this changing after the halving period though and we might set the ATH that will hold us to the next halving only in 2025. As for market correction I will advise anyone DCA to not wait for a heavy fall, once there is a -10% fall that\u2019s one of the best time now to buy because we wouldn\u2019t see the major correction we are waiting for not util a full bearish period","637":"Do you think it is the correct strategy to buy more BTC and HODL?

I admire his views about Bitcoin which in one of his interviews describes as the ultimate form of property and investment asset, emphasizing its role in capital preservation. He once compared Bitcoin to real estate in New York City, suggesting that just as property in NYC is held long-term for its value, Bitcoin serves as the endgame property for wealth preservation. And I couldn't agree more. From their recent purchase of the dip, it is clear that their continuous acquiring Bitcoin is because of their strong belief in its potential for faster appreciation than traditional assets like stocks or real estate. Quote They did try to buy the dip but it has dipped further. Will we see another ATH soon? How long would you HODL if you were in MicroStrategy's position? Of course yes. It is certain that we will see another ATH but not in this month of March. As a person who shares the same strong views and belief in bitcoin as them, I would HODL.

Then a week later they announced another offering for $500M which they would buy bitcoin with.

Since it dipped they will have a better price than the $800M buy which was near the top pretty much.","641":"They are always on schedule, Nah. What I have noticed at the moment is that MicroStrategy's level of confidence in BTC to date is in terms of investment opportunities, the growth of Bitcoin's value in the market in the future is still quite high and on the buying side it doesn't really matter if there are short-term price fluctuations. Indeed, the right time to HODL may vary from person to person, both individual and company, and if MicroStrategy wants to buy again, I think this is the right time while it is still discounted and that is also one of their Long Term Strategy patterns too.","642":"Microstrategy apart from their business-related tasks and their financial documents, they also need to be highly competitive against the ETFs that exists. Don't forget that Microstrategy is a company. They have their shares open on the market, where anyone can be part of the company.

What we should be doing is to follow them and buy as they are buying and see where this take us to.

The price of Bitcoin will keep increasing and companies like MicroStrategy are not taking any chances but always investing. I assume the they don't have any intention to sell their holding in this present bull season so buying at $63,700 is not a bad decision since Bitcoin will always beat it's ATH. Just like El Salvador which has not indicated when they intend to sell, MicroStrategy might keep holding until the price hits $1m. If I am in the company's position I will only sell when the company has a pressing need for finance.

You can see they sold bitcoin shortly after their purchase one day before that sale. It is like their technical step for avoiding taxation and you see these days are December 21 (last purchasing day) and one day later December 22 (their sale). The article emphasizes that MicroStrategy has lost money buy those trades. Quote The firm said it bought approximately 2,395 bitcoins for approximately $42.8 million in cash, at an average price of approximately $17,871 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses, between November 1 and December 21. The transaction was made at an average price of approximately $17,871 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. A day later, the firm sold approximately 704 bitcoins for cash proceeds of approximately $11.8 million, at an average price of approximately $16,776 per bitcoin, net of fees and expenses.

Well microstrategy only strategy is to buy Bitcoin at any price and hold but this is not applicable to everyone especially for the weak heart. Microstrategy has a lot of funds to invest on Bitcoin while they already experience the worst possible scenario on their holding on the last bear market so I really doubt that Saylor will still fear on buying Bitcoin even at peak while most of their holdings is already at profit. For me, It\u2019s important to wait for the market to calm down before you enter so that you can guarantee that there\u2019s no panic anymore to avoid future more dip. It\u2019s better to purchase on a higher price if the market is already in bullish momentum rather than buy on uncertain market with the potential to correct further.","652":"I think MicroStrategy probably doesn't care much about minor changes in prices. I guess they're just accumulating, aren't they? Accumulation is great, it can give a bit more leverage for the future. So yeah, 'buy and hodl' is the correct strategy for them right now, I believe. After all, we only got a brief premature taste of the bull market, but Bitcoin is clearly far from its peak. Maybe we'll have another less bullish period, and then we'll see Bitcoin go up again at the end of 2024, as many expected it to. Selling some if the price goes up really high will make sense at that point.","653":"No content","654":"Hi guys, I've been long fascinated with bitcoin ATM machines and love to spot them wherever I go traveling but haven't seen one for a long time in New York \u2013 are there any of them left in the city at all?

There is no stipulation that after a difficulty reset block that the next block must be the normal difficulty; if the next block is more than 20 minutes after the current block, then it can also have a difficulty of 1. For blocks that are found within 20 minutes of each other, the block's difficulty will be the same as the difficulty of the last block in the difficulty interval whose difficulty was not 1 OR the difficulty of the first block in the difficulty interval. This behavior is defined here: https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/blob\/master\/src\/pow.cpp#L32. The way that the difficulty retarget works is that, at the beginning of the new difficulty interval, the difficulty of the first block in that interval takes the difficulty of the last block in that interval and multiplies that by the time it took to mine the 2016 blocks and then divides it by the target time. The result is then clamped to be at least 1. Since this is based upon the difficulty of the last block in the previous interval, if that block is difficulty 1, then the next interval will also have a difficulty of one. So what we are seeing here is that the last block in the interval is found 20 minutes after the block before it so it has a difficulty of one. Because the next block adjust the difficulty and it only looks at the block before it (which is difficulty 1), the difficulty of the next interval is 1. So the next 2016 blocks are mined at difficulty 1, and the difficulty then slowly adjusts up again.","700":"0.00001550 BTC (0.83 cents USD @ market rate) to just buy one Bitcoin Testnet coin in minutes https:\/\/altquick.com\/exchange\/market\/BitcoinTestnet or accountless with our swap tool https:\/\/altquick.com\/swap\/.

There's no incentive to mine even with a USB miner at difficulty 1, when you can buy a whole coin at such a low rate.

ETF has money, they know it's what many wana be investors of Bitcoin want and that's why the are buying and stocking anyone they got their hands own and you can't blame them, money rules the world. Institutional investors are just clown who want bitcoin but feel native bitcoin isn't something they want to have thier hands own, they prefer to have it inform of ETF, they supply the money because they have it and ETF keep pilling up.

ETF has been approved by the US only. Think what will happen if every major economies start introducing Bitcoin ETF. If we look at the situation that was even surrounding the approval of this ETF bitcoin one could actually see manipulation cards been anticipated. My first thought was why did the government that has actually rejected it before simply turned its ears to it, maybe they seemed to see that it is the only chance to have this big institutions trying to get into bitcoin at one place and then probably kill off not just privacy of the investors but also to try and manipulate the market. Although I still stand that the manipulation wouldn\u2019t be easy as they would hardly control one-third of the coins, but one thing that will definitely help them is the spread of FOMO, it happened when Garyscale started selling there coins off, many follow suit and it affected the market. Personally I am not bothered because this kind of panic are definitely for short term holders, as the market change will affect them.","708":"right now ETF are not gobbling up much new coin most of the coin that go into things like fidelity\/blackrock\/ark came from... wait for it..

There's a chart showing coins held by miners, you can look it up, and that decreased by a lot in January, while before that it was growing for months. For an institution to buy OTC there has to be someone willing to sell OTC and if they're willing to buy over 1k BTC they're not going to contact normal people like us, but mining companies who have the supply to satisfy their demand. Also, GBTC sells using spot bitcoin exchange, while BlackRock and others buy OTC, so your theory of GBTC selling to BlackRock doesn't hold. If this was happening we wouldn't see such a large negative pressure in January from GBTC because they'd sell everything OTC to other funds.","709":"What we can do, is we can't buy the whole BTC supply circulating in the market, and neither we can stop people from selling BTC, they don't know whom they are selling, whether they are on CEXs or are on DEXs, they are just selling and buying without thinking and there is nothing bad in it until they don't consider this fact you talked on. I also know more and more BTC going into the custody of centralized exchanges will mean BTC won't be in the hands of individuals, instead, they will be in the hands of big institutions who will be trading BTC in between. They might not release it in the market. For example, Grayscale sold BTC and was bought by BlackRock and there are many other examples like of ARK's selling BTC future shares to buy its own BTC spot share (ETF). I mean, this can be used to manipulate the market and that's what is happening till now after the approval. But what we can do about it, as I aforementioned we can't buy, can't stop, so all we can do is take profit from the shortage of supply and hold onto what we have now, because the way BTC's supply is going I assume BTC is ntoffar away from touching $250k per unit value.","710":"This is an interesting take at ETFs. I have seen almost everyone in favor of Bitcoin ETF and I am sure that it has something to do with how it will affect the price. Right now though since it has only been approved, there might not be as much companies buying bitcoin and they are not yet the ones who hold the most amount of bitcoin. To us, this might be a great news because these corporations holding bitcoin will definitely drive the price up. We can not do anything regarding this. We can not stop anyone from buying and holding bitcoin. I do wonder if Satoshi expected this to happen. Being the genius he is, I think he did.","711":"This is bound to happen. It was just the community itself and Bitcoin folks that are into this and wishing that the institutions will join the game and they finally did. Realizing that these things have to happen for Bitcoin to grow more in value.

If this was happening we wouldn't see such a large negative pressure in January from GBTC because they'd sell everything OTC to other funds. you should check that GBTC was offering alot of coin on the same platform as blackrock and some other ETFs GBTC and blackrock both use coinbase prime(part of the custody OTC suite) not the standard coinbase public exchange.. know the difference if you look at how many coins GTBC had jan 10th. compared to now. and then look at how many coin all other ETF have now compared to jan 11th.. you will see the shuffling clearer when you look at this https:\/\/platform.arkhamintelligence.com\/explorer\/entity\/blackrock https:\/\/platform.arkhamintelligence.com\/explorer\/entity\/grayscale and this it becomes clearer funny thing is it was miners doing the negative pressure on the standard exchanges, because they were not part of the coinbase prime(custodian swap) deals of exiting one etf to enter the others as for your miner speak the amount of coin that came from GBTC was high.. the amount of coin that came from random miners was near ZERO however there are some ETF that invested into marathon POOL. and they done their own closed door deals(not on public exchange) with ETFs but that amount was not as much as the deals with GBTC other miners who sell pressured in january had nothing to do with the custodian deals. and instead were just selling coin on the open spot exchange know the difference if still unsure look at this image below. notice the gray[scale] below the 0 line.. note the shape and angle of depletion.. compared to the other ETF above the 0 lines and angles of accumulation.. coincidence of consequence.. you choose note the exact points of the 12th, 16th,19th,22nd the pattern[mirror] explains itself","713":"OP, it was clear that the majority of coin ownership would eventually shift to centralised platforms.

Some even leave their money in central services or closed-source, disreputable wallets such as freewallet. For them, investing through an ETF is much better than wasting their currencies to them. Scammers, but if you are thinking beyond investment, then surely the only real Bitcoin is the one that you (alone and no one else) has its private key.","716":"Now for many people this is not a problem, because they are making good profits from the coins that are being gobbled up by the ETFs. I have no problem with that, because ownership of coins should not be restricted, but it is sad to see our coins going into centralized platforms, where people do not have control over the private keys. (The private key are controlled by the trading platform) Those Bitcoin Spot ETFs mostly use Coinbase as their custodian partner and this means your worry is true. Investors in those Bitcoin Spot ETFs have to trust those Bitcoin Spot ETFs and Coinbase to buy and store bitcoins transparently and handle those bitcoin safely as well as without shady activities to steal money from investors. Those investors have their money, their choices and they can make different decisions, by buying shares of Bitcoin Spot ETFs with above risk; or to buy bitcoin by themselves and be self-custodian for their bitcoins. I agree with risk you raised here and it's know by senior bitcoin investors. Not your keys, not your bitcoins.","717":"OP, as a bitcoiner, sure its sad. But as a realist, nothing wrong with it. People can use bitcoin any way they want to. People storing bitcoin in centralized ways for convenience, whether in ETFs or just having their bitcoin custodied by companies, means those services of convenience get better. Convenient services always increases adoption for a technology. Increasing adoption is good for Bitcoin. Gate-keeping Bitcoin only to purists is not good for Bitcoin. For example, if we expected everyone to run their own node and custody their own Bitcoin, Bitcoin would never be all that useful because most people would never bother owning any Bitcoin. An analogy: It'd be like if you expected everyone who owns a car to know how to do all the repairs on their own car. If that were the case not enough people would own cars to have it be worthwhile for the govt to build roads everywhere and thus transportation would be much worse which would hinder society. Sure, ideally, we all can fix our own cars, but in reality only a minority of people will be that hardcore group. Now of course key management is much easier than learning automobile repair, but its the same situation. There's going to be a certain amount of people taking full advantage of all of Bitcoin's powers - self-custody, running their own node, maybe even operating a mining machine. While there are going to be a lot more people self-custodying but not running their own node. While there will likely be even more people using an entire industry's apparatus for allowing them to own and\/or use their Bitcoin conveniently without worrying about how Bitcoin works. Sure, you lose power with convenience, but you can still be a Bitcoin participant by taking the convenient and less powerful route. Humans appreciate convenience, and people tend to have a limited amount of things or areas that they want to be 'hardcore' about. For many people they may want bitcoin but Bitcoin is not going to be one of the areas they care to become an expert in. Just like your average stock investor is just putting away a bit of money each paycheck into an index fund for retirement, rather than reading up on company quarterlies and picking stocks based on a bunch of their own research. Just like most people are going to pay someone to fix their car, even very simple things like changing a bulb or changing the oil, rather than learn about how to do it themselves. Just like, well everything, in which most people will choose to pay for convenience over needing to apply their own bandwidth to be self-sufficient, because everyone has limited bandwidth. People are free to use Bitcoin at any level, whether it is the ideal monetary sovereignty level taking full advantage of Bitcoin, or the \"this is just an investment held in a bank or investment firm\" level. As bitcoiners we can always recommend people the best way to have Bitcoin is to take advantage of as many of its revolutionary powers as possible, but we have to accept lots of people aren't gonna want to bother with that. And that is entirely natural and expected, and not something to fret over, or claim Bitcoin is no longer decentralized because of (as some people do). You can only control your own actions. If you hold your own Bitcoin, be proud of that, and be thankful that your self-custodied Bitcoin is becoming ever more useful as more people adopt Bitcoin in whatever way they desire, because greater adoption means greater Bitcoin acceptance and eventually we get to the point where you can largely live on a Bitcoin standard instead of a fiat standard, if that is your ideal goal.","718":"there are no issues in how people want to use bitcoin, but we should atleast strive to point out the risks and not just play promotion platitude ass kissing (people on this forum have already heard the word bitcoin to have even found this forum. so they do not need the cheerful whispers of utopian promotional recruitment speak, they are now looking for the real, factual information and risks they need to be aware of) bitcoin in CEX have no insurance. so unlike a bank you do not have the $250k FDIC insurance use a CEX if you day trade where depositing\/withdrawing is a hassle but realise the risks. and note the \"you can lose all your investments\" slogan holding long term because you have no intent to sell anytime soon. its best to suggest storing on ones own private key. but note the risks of different wallet, software and what they do or dont offer .. those taking advantage of ETF share buys. should know although they get tax advantages whilst getting exposure to the spot price. they need to know their broker, ETF trust at their sole discretion can close the share offering. and shares are not claims to any rights to any asset held. you cannot redeem bitcoin spot ETF for actual bitcoin. you only have price exposure at a share ratio to bitcoin price based on the Nav number the ETF trust chooses and can change at their sole discretion without needing to give notice or get votes from share holders","719":"ETF this, ETF that, I think that people are now reasoning better, this is unlike how it was so lousy before the approval.

I see no big deal in this, but it's nevertheless the hype of people. However, it is plainly the means by which the corporate entities will be able to control Bitcoin indirectly. The more we make it accessible to them, the more centralised it becomes. Sincerely, I just didn't feel it the way people felt it at that filing time, Bitcoin was already accessible before it, so what? As it is now, I do not know the model at which they will operate eventually and start allowing people access as they've not started fully, but no way this will not increase government oversight.","720":"ETF this, ETF that, I think that people are now reasoning better, this is unlike how it was so lousy before the approval.

(72%) left. meaning 28% lost in one month eventually other ETF's are going to syphon coins from the open spot market instead of shuffling. and these large basket purchases will directly affect spot price.. as for the effect on the other ecosystems such as merchant use and services offered.. well gold is not used in retail purchases of goods or services, so not much positive impact on merchant use due to being seen as an investment asset.. what bitcoiners need to do is not wait for ETF investments to spark some commercial investment into fixing bitcoin utility annoyances, because so far those commercial investments have produced unfinished sandbox subnetworks used as workaround of work around of work around to the annoyances that prevent bitcoin utility, all of which have not helped bitcoin utility, but just promoted people should use bitcoin less.. so no positive impact there we need a fresh set of eyes, a fresh set of devs to go back to scratch and propose different strategies to solve bitcoin scaling\/utility. that actually benefits bitcoiners. ETF businesses have put a stake in the ground to say they see bitcoin as something that will be around for years. but now we have to get on and actually start proposing proper proposals to make bitcoin easy, cheaper to use for the benefit of bitcoiners instead of waiting for commercialised flawed sandboxes to solve things for us","721":"I do agree with you OP.

This will not be right for the real purpose of bitcoin as peer to peer cash. However, this is not the fault of the people. Similar to what has been argued before, this might be the fault of bitcoin's monetary policy.

But as an investment is not a bad move at all. Right now the price is $39.58 and it could have a massive jump in the next months. So, good luck with your investment. Not sure if I got you right, but the ETFs hold real Bitcoins. Although you do not actually own the actual keys, the physical share of Bitcoin within the ETFs is in principle yours, even if you can never transfer them to your wallet. The issue is that now you are trusting that a third party is actually holding that amount of bitcoin instead of holding that amount yourself, and we know that those third parties have a horrible record when it comes to that, so anyone that is serious about owning bitcoin needs to go through the trouble of creating a wallet, buy bitcoin and send that bitcoin to their wallet, I know that this includes additional steps but it is way better than to rely on someone else.","744":"No content","745":"Metamask now supporting bitcoin or a mistake from the news?

Summary: MetaMask does not support the Bitcoin network directly due to compatibility issues with its Ethereum-based infrastructure. However, Bitcoin users have alternatives like Leather Wallet for managing Bitcoin and its related assets, including BTC, STX, and BRC-20 tokens. For integrating Bitcoin into MetaMask, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) offers a solution by tokenizing BTC on the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, the development of Bitcoin-specific MetaMask Snaps could potentially expand Bitcoin's accessibility within the MetaMask ecosystem. @OP this is just some twisted information to click bait readers.","750":"Some months ago (early last year, I guess), there was also information stating that Metamast has allowed its customers to purchase cryptocurrencies directly on the wallet with just the use of their debit visa card.

If it is supporting Bitcoin what big difference it can make in the already competitive Bitcoin wallet market? Looking at the present condition, a Bitcoin user would like a wallet that provides privacy for transactions made through it. I do not think Metamask can come up with such kind of solution as that which is cheap. As for getting into a Bitcoin wallet is a good sign as WBTC, like tokens won't be considered as a first option for Bitcoin. Now users would be more interested in getting Bitcoin than wrapped tokens which are nothing but ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The same analogy would go for tokens that are on the Binance blockchain but are not original Bitcoin.

MetaMask supports Bitcoin, but not in the way an exchange wallet accepts the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is not an ERC-20 token, so the largest cryptocurrency is not accepted directly by MetaMask. However, you can get BTC into your MetaMask in a roundabout way. That said, do not try to send Bitcoin directly to your MetaMask. If you try to do so, MetaMask will not be able to receive the token, which could lead to negative consequences.

All the responses above explain why. But, to be fair, many platforms who say they now \"support\" Bitcoin, don't do so directly. Many merchants \"supporting\" Bitcoin actually only accept Bitcoin through a 3rd party (you send this party Bitcoin and they settle your payment with the merchant) or don't even actually deal in Bitcoin. PayPal famously supported Bitcoin buys for US people some time back, but you really were just paying them to display a Bitcoin balance on their account. Couldn't withdraw it to a Bitcoin wallet.

And of course it will also be very profitable for related provider companies.","764":"I also haven't seen Bitcoin's network on Metamask.

Previously, Bitcoin was mainly used for the purpose of storing and transferring money, there were no applications used on the Bitcoin network. But recently, with the explosion of Ordinals and NFTs on the Bitcoin network, in the future user needs will need wallets that support the use of the Bitcoin network like other networks such as EVM or non-EVM, so Bitcoin's official network update wallets is just a matter of time.","765":"No content","766":"Hey everyone, Ever wondered how Bitcoin is throwing a global party in the world of remittances? this digital disruptor is having on the traditional money transfer scene,just a chat about how Bitcoin is playing the international money game differently.

I won't say just Bitcoin, but any other crypto currency that has a stable value can do great in international transactions. I believe cryptos are indeed used for global remittances. Just not being used by the corporates but by the individuals. Only in this field, Bitcoins transaction confirmation time looks faster than the traditional banking system.

Anyone else experiencing the joys of Bitcoin remittances? Cheers to the crypto curious, Before the mempool began to be congested by ordinal inscriptions Bitcoin was seen as one of the cheapest means of transferring money internationally. But this is no longer the case because transaction fees are now very expensive compared to traditional bank transactions. I know some business owners who were relying solely on Bitcoin to buy goods from other countries including a nation that banned Bitcoin. Out of frustration because of these high tx fees, they are been forced to go back to bank transfers. Most bank transfers are instantaneous, while BTC blocks are found ~ 10 minutes on average. The difference is that the banking system is centralized, and so sent funds can be confiscated by the bank and reversed back to the senders account, i.e. in cases of scam and suspicious transfers, but once a block in the BTC network has been mined, it becomes irreversible and immutable. That's true, some bank transactions take a few seconds, however, the advantage Bitcoin still has is its decentralized nature that gives you full control over your funds which is a feature that banks lack. With Bitcoin, you can remain pseudonymous\/anonymous which is important to many people. However, the adoption of Bitcoin as a currency is been slowed down by these high tx fees and I hope this issue will be solved in the future.","773":"Using Bitcoin for payments is very enjoyable and very easy. The convenience that can be felt when using Bitcoin for payments is that there is no time limit that requires us to wait like bank services when the working time is over, then we have to make delivery the next day. Between us and the second party we only need fast internet service and a Bitcoin address that can still be accessed. Shipping costs are also cheap unless there are problems such as transaction delays caused by several reasons so the costs are a little expensive.

Love Bitcoin but this is the truth. It is perfect for most of its use cases when the Mempool is alright. Otherwise, it kind of sucks and becomes the Currency where only the Rich have a chance. So Bitcoin is slightly becoming more and more a store of value instead. You can move it once an year and not care much about Fees. Consolidate when Fees are low enough and so on. Remittances however are not the best use case for it unless you think about Transaction speed. The other party can have their Bitcoin in their account in minutes. But this is directly linked to Fees. High fees, delayed inclusion of the Transaction in a Block. Which defeats the purpose of using Bitcoin for quickness. Otherwise there are other things to think about too. For example volatility. It is great when Bitcoin is in a Bull run but it becomes really annoying when you work your butt off for a full month, earn a thousand and by the time your relatives get to use the money it is worth 20 percent less already.","778":"Bitcoin transactions are still cheaper than most remittances between banks, especially if you're sending money across the borders of your country.

For the sake of the argument, bank transfers are instant if both people use the same bank. Try using two separate banks and see how much time it might take. Try again, but select a recipient from outside the borders of your country. It's more than 10 minutes. Remittances can take up to three with four days.

Receivers may find themselves under unnecessary problems too. Due to Bank procedures, just like those who send.

If it is more than four three digits, I can barely find a period where it is less expensive with Bitcoin.

I also in the process to set up a crypto payment system in my shops and I got help from this forum with the process. \ud83d\ude4f If I am allowed to ask how about you, what is the best thing that have come to you thanks to Bitcoin (crypto)? And is it any negative that came from it? What we all can and should do is to say thank you to Satoshi! \ud83d\ude4f Without him we probably never would have been here and educate us self, and we don't only learn about Bitcoin we learn about how to handle many situations in life.","788":"Hi BT what is the best thing that have ever happen to you because of BTC that never would have happen if BTC never was invented?

In my opinion or my experience Bitcoin has made sending funds to my intended receiver fast, cheaper and no third party(bank or government). interference, Bitcoin has giving me the anonymity and privacy I need as I am my own bank, I can save my asset without the rigorous and privacy compromising process needed to open a bank account.","789":"the best thing is that thanks to bitcoin I get an small income every month from trading To be honest, you chose the worst possible way to interact with bitcoin. There were so many ways to approach this.

If that's too ambitious, the easiest way is to buy and hold, become an investor, maybe a miner if you can afford it, a node operator... Let's say that's too ambitious, maybe start doing DCA? Maybe get a forum \"job\" and get paid in bitcoin... No, you chose to use bitcoin as the fiat making machine. Buy some, wait a day for it to go 5% up, sell, pay fees, send it to the bank and pay your tax and boom, you've made a whole 1% in pure profit. Congratulations.

I'm making some fiat money every day thanks to your invention.","790":"The best thing that ever happened to me because of BTC was that i become part of this forefront development in the finance in transforming to digital currency.

Thank you Satoshi! \ud83d\ude4f I think majority will agree that we learn to be save because one tenet of bitcoin, if you really wanted to make a huge profit, is to accumulate and hold for a long time. It's more of a mental battle here, but if you understand it then it will be easy on your part for a weekly or monthly grind and doing DCA. I'm not sure about trading though, I'm not into it because it might take sometime on my end. I have other jobs to do so I just invest whatever I can and again, it's a slow process but it's reward in the end. Just like in what we are right now, bitcoin has recovered from the lowest low last year, yet we are all looking for the block halving next year. So we still have a lot of time to accumulate and then wait for it to happen as it is a catalyst for next bull run and new all time high.","792":"There isn't a single best thing that happened in my life because of Bitcoin but many best things that happened in my life because of Bitcoin.

I can say that I'm currently living my life with no financial problems and all thanks goes to Bitcoin only.

All of this that you mentioned are much easier said than done. Hopw many businesses you know that pay their employees in bitcoin, or accept bitcoin directly P2P without a 3rd party payment processor? Probably not many, as its not easy at all. No, you chose to use bitcoin as the fiat making machine.

Hi BIT-TENDER Thank you for answering in my thread. I don't know how you works or who you are my friend, but we are all different we humans and I can assure you I would not find more or better friends outside this world then I have now. I would also never in my life make the same amount from stocks or another asset, the P2P trading I am doing is only efficient with BTC. And you have right, nothing can solve the problem on the earth or an individuals problem, then individuals and the individual himself, but what he can do is to find paths that will help him reach his goal and BTC have helped me a lot further in my journey! And I am glad Bitcoin gave you the anonymity and privacy I you needed as a bank owner, good job mate and keep grinding!

I have a business that very soon will accept crypto you can read more here: https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=5470493.msg63002228#msg63002228 I P2P trade. I don't wait for Bitcoin to go up or down. I buy from one person I know very cheap, then I sell it on P2P websites and make quite good profit (maybe you haven't heard of this yet?). I also HODL Bitcoin and some more assets, but I can't find a reason for not P2P trading since its more or less like a passive income each month and I make more then enough to pay my bills, put food on the table for me and my cats and also keep and HODL crypto for the future. Thanks and keep grinding!","795":"In as much that Bitcoin brought financial freedom to everyone either from government or becoming rich and others, I love bitcoin because since the creation of bitcoin has been solving problems while the first problem its officially solved brought the inception of a new technology(Blockchain) to the world after the challenges faced in inventing a functioning Blockchain was fixed by it. Now so many types of Blockchain but all this were possible by a simple action by Satoshi in implementing PoW mechanism, God bless Satoshi for his wisdom and knowledge.","796":"There are a few things I want to say in this case, the first is that I don't consider it a delay when in bitcoin because in the end everything that is done whether it's from a few years ago or just starting out all has its portion especially with the situation a few months earlier where bitcoin was still experiencing a decline that was enough to make us comfortable in buying then it was never too late for this. Secondly I feel that your approach to bitcoin is a little harsh and self-defeating, Not to demean and belittle your strategy but trading with your status as a beginner then the risk is quite high and I'm not even too sure you are profitable every month so therefore instead of using difficult methods it would be better to make a new thing where you do it by investing not trading. Indeed in this case trading is also quite good but it will not be able to be done by beginners who are still very high risk and I do not recommend this for beginners.","797":"One of the best things for me is that I can receive payments and make transactions seamlessly with it. Another is the independence of my finance. I have Salem control over it and can make purchases with ease as well as investments for the future. If not for the high fees we experience currently, the use of it to secure a happy Christmas celebration would have paid off well, but we know how it is that even the interest rates has even increased as well as the price of BTC and cost of transaction fees between P2p and for payments from the memepool. Still it is still one of the best things that has happened to me.","798":"The best thing? The absolute best part of getting into crypto was meeting all the awesome people in the community. I've made some really interesting connections and gotten to work on some super neat projects that literally wouldn't even exist without bitcoin and blockchain being a thing. The whole mindset shift that came along with decentralized finance is fascinating to me.","799":"Hi BT what is the best thing that have ever happen to you because of BTC that never would have happen if BTC never was invented?

Thank you Satoshi! \ud83d\ude4f On the friends aspect, i agree with that because I have come across a lot of people while interacting in Bitcoin and i must say that, I wouldn't have met them if for bitcoin had brought our interests together and involved in it related discussions, is very important for us to make a clear standing on the human aspect which can not be measured in terms of monetary aspects, because many times we tend to focus only on the profits side of things cryptocurrency has offered us a lot of chances to interact with other on different bases and we can't take that for granted at this point, much more also we had a lot of careers support through crypto and that have been much helpful to many of us.","800":"The best thing about Bitcoin is that it's changed my life. If there weren't Bitcoin, then I couldn't become a crypto marketer and couldn't earn a handsome amount that changed my life.

Secondly I have been dependants on bitcoin for long period now and It worths saying thank to bitcoin especially we the africans precisely Nigeria it has help in giving youth employment which they are busy with learning either trading or something that would generate income at the end of week\/month and there are lots of people who are always occupying themselves with content creation and skits making. The only regrets I would mention of bitcoin is not holding enough and not joining when it was launched though then it wasn't that clear and understandable to our regions even as that I am not still sure I would hold till date, so in all ramification it has impacted in my life positively.","802":"Well, talking about friends, yeah, I got to meet some new class of friends when I joined the crypto space, and I have also been able to win some people into Bitcoin, and they became my friends too. If not for Bitcoin, I would not have gotten to meet a few friends that have actually been very helpful to me in one way or another. I have also made a profit from my Bitcoin investment, and I think that if I had not invested the money in Bitcoin, it might have gone into some other investment that might not have been as fruitful as Bitcoin or into some scam projects. Some years ago, I invested in one company that disappeared with my money, and I always regret that experience because if I had invested in Bitcoin with that money, I know I would not have lost the money.","803":"Hi BT what is the best thing that have ever happen to you because of BTC that never would have happen if BTC never was invented?

People who had the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin at its early stages were fortunate, but it doesn't mean those who invested at this time were late because no one can forecast the exact amount Bitcoin will reach in the future. Instead of being sorry that you were late, it is best to invest now when the price is still rising because we don't know how the price will appear in the near future.","804":"The best thing about Bitcoin is that it's changed my life.

So big thanks to Satoshi Nakamoto for a life-changing gift. Yeah, majority of us who found bitcoin early, it give us a way to earn, like joining signature campaigns and then we can start from that. Whether we trade or just be a hold and regular investor. And as someone said, the financial freedom that we got from it. I joined in 2017, so obviously I was able to catch the bull run that time, and it really taught me a lot as far as investing goes. And with the profits I got, I was able to buy things not just for me but for my family as well. So big thanks to Satoshi and his creation, although up to this time there are still a lot of negative things that we hear about it, but for those who have been in the market long enough knows that Bitcoin is the best thing that happened to us.","805":"Hi BT what is the best thing that have ever happen to you because of BTC that never would have happen if BTC never was invented?

I wouldn't experienced having that kind of money if I only relied on my monthly salary in my day job before even working for several years up to decades. Because of crypto, I never imagined some of the good things that happened in my life that I didn't even expect to happen. Able to build our own house, own a car, 2 motorcycles, a decent brand bicycle, an upgraded PC, and many more. I didn't expect those things to happen in reality as I'm just an average earner.

Though the concept of Bitcoin is to become peer-to-peer payment transactions, but our perspective is to make a potential profit which makes Bitcoin rapidly increase users and holders.

Bollocks, a new domain, doesn't even appear in the first or even second page of Google organic results; they just created a fake website with a free domain and hosting, choosing a template that is either free or cheap to purchase.

The insurance company will have to pay for damages even when you have not paid enough premiums to cover the cost of settlement.

I just feel everyone needs to know this. Nice shill, thanks but no thanks. Wallet insurance? You are your own insurance and the one that makes it secure. The standard is to understand that \"not your keys, not your coins\". That's basic and simple but hard to maintain that when you're too greedy and think that these money projected by scampanies are for real, you will definitely going to be the victim of their scam. But maybe this might be a real thing in the future but won't just be offered by some random website but most likely the banks.","826":"Insurance only works if the currency has unlimited supply, since Bitcoin has a limited supply, it simply only people without brains can trust it. Trusting your coins to a centralized site is also defeat the purpose of decentralization. Conventional insurance service is not a scam or a waste of time. It's not scam as long as you pick a legitimate insurance service, as for waste of time, it's really subjective because they often ask too much process to claim the insurance.","827":"I just found this place, it says it's insured up to $50,000.

Right now there would be plenty of empty space so fees would still be almost nothing so miners would likely be making less. But eventually as adoption increases blocks would fill up no matter what size they are and yes miners would be earning roughly 10x, well probably not quite 10x but close to it.","831":"I doubt the equation is as simple as if space is increased by 10, they will multiply their profits by 10. As thecodebear says I think especially in the beginning it would mean that there would be empty space in the blocks, and if there is empty space it means that people could send transactions with the minimum fee and get a confirmation in the next block. Hypothetically, if the blocks were filled consistently the fees would go up but how much the miners would charge in fees per block would depend on a lot of things, like whether there were still suckers filling the blockchain with spam.","832":"Although I already voted but it is not a simple yes no question. It depends on whether Bitcoin is going to continue to survive like that. We are talking about 40 MB blocks every 10 minutes which nodes have to download and fully verify and a blockchain that grows 5.76 GB per day. The effects of it will first show up as the number of full nodes drastically drop in short term and eventually we move to more centralization and more full nodes that are run on cloud services (another form of centralization). The effects could also include more stale blocks and even some mining pools going back to the terrible spy\/spv mining methods where they mine empty blocks because they're waiting for the last block be verified and can not include new txs in their next block yet. This could all translate into bitcoin price dropping and the miners' revenue significantly decreasing in terms of fiat as the exchange rate would be much lower.","833":"No, they would most likely earn less. The only reason why fees are high now and people are paying high fees is because only 2500 or so transactions can fit in a block. So if they increased it by 10x the mempool wouldn\u2019t be clogged and people would pay the min 1 sat byte fee and miners would end up actually making less money. And we would also lose nodes due to the bandwidth and space requirements for such large blocks.","834":"whomever keep suggesting miners need\/deserve\/should have 10 more fee's does not understand the market dynamics\/economics.. miners were not starving when btc was $17k, they are not starving now its $43k This could all translate into bitcoin price dropping and the miners' revenue significantly decreasing in terms of fiat as the exchange rate would be much lower. nodes on the network do not translate to market price effects most nodes on the network do not even fully validate or archive any more (see: backward compatibility, witness validation bypass, archive data pruning) .. also 10x blocks may not equal 10x transactions. and wont equate to 10x fees if they just expanded the metadata\/witness area and not redefine the base block size it would be a possibility of bloat filling the 39mb witness but still not effect the transaction count .. however if they re define the base vs witness to be EG 10mb base 30mb witness it will allow 10x tx. by which users can pay 10x less in fees individually but then have 10x more transactions per block which would allow pools to still get the same fee total bonus .. however even before doing a 10x of blocksize under current design, we can EASILY undo some cludgy code to then allow the current 4mb block to actually utilise the full allocation of 4mb for tx data(lean fully validated transactions again) to gain more transactions per block before even doing say 3x .. where by then when doing a 3x would result in more transactions paying less but totalling more in fees bonus for pools than the current block design 10x'd think about it if 1mb base had a lean tx count potential of 4200tx a block(calculated by satoshi himself in 2010) having a lean fully utilised 4mb has potential of 16,800tx. which 3x the block then would be 50,400tx .. using just 12mb blocks however current design 4mb only averages 4200tx which 10x would only be 42,000 using 40mb blocks .. the math. if current tx fee is $25 under the current 25% base 75% witness\/metadata model of 40mb the transactions could become $2.50 individually totalling the same $105k under the 100% utilised block model of 12mb the transactions could become $2.50 individually totalling $126k under the 100% utilised block model of 12mb the transactions could become $2.10 individually totalling the same $105k common sense, logic shows uncludging the blocks. make tx lean and then scale up by just 3x can allow better then 10x fee less per transactor without taking amounts away from pools and without needing to LEAP to 10x blocks of junk","835":"I'm just curious about speculation. I'm curious about your curiosity...Do you know something we don't? I would think that the block reward would still be the same, in line with how it works currently. The difference in what miners earn is an interesting topic. The amount of fees that a miner could accumulate, yes, would amount to more potentially...I say potentially as the fee may be lower due to the block size able to fit more transactions, though the increased amount of transactions may mean that they make more...it really depends on the activity of the network and if these blocks are being filled, and if premiums are still being paid in order to be able to be included in the next block. My vote is no, because I don't think it would result in 10x earnings.","836":"No, miners would not necessarily earn 10x more per block if Bitcoin blocks were 10x larger. Transaction fees do contribute to a miner\u2019s earnings, the larger the block, and the more transactions in it, the larger the fee for the miner. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that a 10x larger block would contain 10x more transactions or yield 10x more in fees. It would depend on the number and types of transactions that are included in the block. So, while larger blocks could potentially contain more transactions and thus higher transaction fees, they wouldn\u2019t directly lead to miners earning 10x more per block.","837":"Bigger blocks may cost smaller miners: small miners and poorly-connected miners are at a disadvantage if larger blocks are produced, and even large and well-connected miners may find that large blocks reduce their profit percentage if the cost of bandwidth rises too high or their stale rate increases. Hello. I am from F2Pool. We are currently mining the biggest blocks on the network. So far top 100 biggest bitcoin blocks are all from us. We do support bigger blocks and sooner rather than later. But we cannot handle 20 MB blocks right now. I know most blocks would not be 20 MB over night. But only if a small fraction of blocks more than 10 MB, it could dramatically increase of our orphan rate, result of higher fee to miners. Bad miners could attack us and the network with artificial big blocks. As yhou know, other Chinese pools, AntPool, BW, they produces ASIC chips and mining mostly with their own machines. They do not care about a few percent of orphan increase as much as we do. They would continue their zero fee policy. We would be the biggest loser. As the exchanges had taught us, zero fee is not health to the network. Also we have to redevelop our block broadcast logic. Server bandwidth is a lot more expensive in China. And the Internet is slow. Currently China has more than 50% of mining power, if block size increases, I bet European and American pools could suffer more than us. We think the max block size should be increased, but must be increased smoothly, 2 MB first, and then after one or two years 4 MB, then 8 MB, and so on. Thanks. Based on the above information, only big miners that have cheap mining rigs, cheap electricity cost and fast internet connection are make money, while the others aren't especially the small miners. Bigger blocks would decrease transaction fees, but big blocks might trigger Bitcoin's security, it's better to choose good security with expensive fees instead of low security with cheaper fees.","838":"I do not understand those technical things. But I understand a few simple things. The block reward will same but the fees they earn from each transaction could increase according to the number of transactions. But there are other possibilities too. If there are always fewer transactions, the mempool will remain empty and the transaction fee will be cheap as heck. So, Imagine a single block containing more than 35K transactions but all of them used less than 5 sat\/vB fee. So, If I am not wrong, the miners won't make much money. We don't have to increase the block size to 10x at this moment. All it could be 2x max. It will help balance the network.","839":"My take: short-term, miners will earn less because currently fees are high because of full blocks. But long-term, a higher transaction volume will lead to more paying users and can lead to more earnings.","840":"Bitcoin miners solve math and find Bitcoin blocks to get income from block subsidy and transaction fees. How easy or hard it is for finding block will depend on Bitcoin network difficulty, total hash rate and hash rate of that miners, mining farm. I understand like if block size is x10 or x100 than now, will it cause network difficulty higher at the same rate of x10 or x100. With my knowledge, they don't have such correlation. Because of no correlation, miners don't need to get x10 or x100 earning because of block size increase.","841":"Bigger blocks may cost smaller miners: small miners and poorly-connected miners are at a disadvantage if larger blocks are produced, and even large and well-connected miners may find that large blocks reduce their profit percentage if the cost of bandwidth rises too high or their stale rate increases.

Bigger blocks would decrease transaction fees, but big blocks might trigger Bitcoin's security, it's better to choose good security with expensive fees instead of low security with cheaper fees. But it's been many years since those points mentioned. Most miner\/pool would have better hardware and internet at this point and various technology (such as company) allows faster block verification and propagation. And as miners will depend more on TX fee as their income, they're less likely to mine empty block.","842":"Larger blocks mean more transactions per block, but fees may not increase. Larger blocks reduce transaction space competition, lowering transaction fees. Miners may process more transactions at reduced fees. Larger blocks present additional complications. Since fewer miners can afford the higher processing power and storage expenses, centralization may result. This centralization violates Bitcoin's decentralization. Larger blocks may enhance throughput, but they dont necessarily increase miners' revenue. Block size affects miner profitability depending on market conditions and technology. Due to reduced urgency and competition for block space, a 10x block size increase may minimize transaction fees.","843":"Of course not. That's why increasing the block size is a headless idea. On the other hand, if blocks are not filled up, fees will collapse to 1 sat\/byte and all of the miners will be put out of business. That will lead to lower hashrate, which means the price will start collapsing too.","844":"if blocks are not filled up, fees will collapse to 1 sat\/byte and all of the miners will be put out of business. That will lead to lower hashrate, which means the price will start collapsing too.

That will lead to lower hashrate, which means the price will start collapsing too. So you're saying 36 million dollars per day isn't enough for miners? Where did you get that figure from if I may ask? If this is from the current exchange rate, then what you need to know is that while I don't know what the average transaction size is (which would greatly help doing this calculation), I do know there are only between 5k-20k transactions in a block most of the time. If I be optimistic and guess the average is 500 sats\/vbyte (including Ordinals), and that there are about 20k transactions, that's 10 million sats per block or 1BTC in fees. Whether this will be enough to support an operation depends on the particular miner. For now, most miners would not be affected by such a change because of the coinbase fee, but what if the BTC price becomes flat in the future and the coinbase is no longer enough to support miners? Many miners have huge loans open lines of credit, so in this case since fees are also stable and not increasing, then many of them would be forced to close shop. Edit: to reach $36m a day at these prices, you'd have to find nearly 100 blocks a day. That will take about 1000 minutes or 16 hours and 40 mins, but that is impossible for a single miner since that means they'd have to have way over 50% of the global hashrate. Something like $10m per day is more likely, but only for the largest miners.","846":"So you're saying 36 million dollars per day isn't enough for miners? Where did you get that figure from if I may ask? It's 6.25BTC block reward, 6 times per hour and 24 times per day. Back in 2017, I read someone saying the \"fee wars\" shouldn't start for a few decades. The block reward should be more than enough to pay for miners for a long time to come.","847":"I doubt the equation is as simple as if space is increased by 10, they will multiply their profits by 10.

Hypothetically, if the blocks were filled consistently the fees would go up but how much the miners would charge in fees per block would depend on a lot of things, like whether there were still suckers filling the blockchain with spam. From my level of knowledge I'd say that it'll depend if Bitcoin adoption will increase by 10\u00d7, if it does then miners can maybe earn up to that number, if not then the blocks increasing by 10\u00d7 will automatically mean a reduction in miners earnings. My calculations are based on simple mathematical reasoning, but as there's more analysis to it, then I'm good to learning from more experienced members that have been doing justice to the topic so far.","848":"Tthe answer to the question is obviously no! There are only 1vMB of transactions willing to pay over 150sat\/vb and you need to go to 100sat\/vb to fill a 10vMB block, so pretty simple! It's just like an auction, you will find a guy paying 20 million for a rare Ferrari, you will have troubles finding 100! Will they make more than currently, probably yes, but by how much that's crystal globe magic! So you're saying 36 million dollars per day isn't enough for miners? Both hashrate and the reward in $ are a bit meaningless if out of context. We have 500 exahash, is the network a million times more secure than in 2013? Miners are earning 36 million does that make the network how much secure compared to previous years? It's all a question of how much you're protecting an with how much you're defending, are $36 million a day enough for miners to build a wall against somebody wanting to attacks bitcoin now? Maybe! Assuming Bitcoin goes to 400k and the chain holds 8 trillions in value, does that value still project the same security, of course not. The exact math you did tells you the situation pretty well, you're getting paid 6.25 BTC per block to guard 19 millions BTC Then you will get 3.12 BTC a block to guard 19 million BTC. Then...you get the picture. Of course not. That's why increasing the block size is a headless idea. On the other hand, if blocks are not filled up, fees will collapse to 1 sat\/byte and all of the miners will be put out of business. That will lead to lower hashrate, which means the price will start collapsing too. If people won't be making enough transactions to fill a 10vMB block even at 1sat\/vb 5 years from now then we have others things of concerned.

However, if you can\u2019t fully focus on it, you\u2019re likely to fail in the end. That\u2019s why I suggest you evaluate what you\u2019re capable of doing. Holding is simple and can be profitable, but day trading might give you consistent profits if you\u2019re willing to dedicate time and effort. Also, trading isn\u2019t a scam as long as you\u2019re dealing with legit coins, like Bitcoin and high-volume altcoins.

I noticed that holding a coin for the bullrun is much more profitable than any form of Trading(scalping, daytrading , even swing trading) . Am I trading wrong or Is trading really a scam . Markets are unpredictable, Successful traders uses technical and fundamental analysis to analyze and predict the market direction before taking a trade, some traders like swing traders can have a certain trade setup which unless that setup shows up, they will not take any trade, that's patient and discipline. So, every trader, depending on the type of trader you are, can make profit from trading if they are using the right strategy and also sticking with that strategy, having a good risk to reward management ability, being patient and discipline and also making sure they take a trade only when all their confluences are met. Some persons would say that trading is more profitable for them than holding and some will say holding is more profitable for them, all of that depends on the ability of what you can handle. If holding is working for you, stick to it. Despite that there are many traders that are making profit from the market, even with their perfect strategy, they still get losses most of the time, that's because the market is dynamic and you can not be right about its direction all the time. The conclusion is that, trading is profitable as much as holding. From my experience in trading crypto futures and also averaging, I would say that getting 30% off the market three or two times a week is very possible.","872":"Now I've been in crypto since 2022.

Holding a coin for long term and placing a trade can both be profitable depending on your skills and decision making. Both holding a coin for long term and placing a trade have their own risk. For example, some people going into trading just to make quick profit without having the core understanding of the market, knowing when to place trade and when not to place trade. Contrary to this, holding a coin for a long term can only be profitable during the market bull run but after that you can predict what will happen next, whether the coin will continue to bullish or dip.","873":"My strategy is a bit of a hybrid, in that my holding online is in the form of buy and sell offers. Over the years my coins have tended to experience less activity as more and more and more coins and tokens are created, dividing the audience as it were. Back when there were only 30 or less coins to choose from they all saw a lot of activity every day. Once there were 300 types in existence individual choices slowed down in activity. Same as more and more exchanges came online, dividing activity among them as well as among all the things they listed. So over time my huge columns of buy and sell offers became more and more like holding, less and less like trading. For example my BTC\/XLM pair on one exchange has experienced over 24 hours of no trades two or three times lately, with XLM price in terms of BTC hovering between my lowest sell offer and my highest buy offer. But a few more days back it was more volatile, sometimes taking two or more of my buy offers and two or more of my sell offers by the time I woke up and re-placed my proceeds onto the other side of the order-book, replenishing my columns of offers. With IXC\/BTC on FreiExchange just yesterday someone bought up a huge chunk of my column of sell offers, but the price there is so very low I make my buy offers column massively more \"dense\" than my column of sell offers as I know when price is near the bottom it tends to attract \"dumps\". So right now there is a big gap between my highest buy offer and my lowest sell offer although my buy offers still cover every satoshi of price down to 1 satoshi and my sell offers still cover every ten satoshis of price way up into the thousands of satoshis. So in effect I am holding both bitcoin and IXCoin there and have been for year upon year upon year, but more and more and more of them over time, from time to time taking out some of one or both as profits to hold at home or to cash out. In summary yes it actually works but my strategy is to blanket cover the whole range of up and down rather than just place one offer and a stop-loss or stop-gain as it were, so I gain hugely on the big sudden movements by catching them one pre-placed step at a time with my huge ladders \/ columns of steps. -MarkM-","874":"Now I've been in crypto since 2022.

Because we are only small retail traders, we are being watched by larger trading companies or groups. For example, those who trade futures have a tool like Coinglass that finds all trading positions and liquidation areas. If you take a position, they can see it and target your liquidation margin to take you out of the market. So, if you are trading futures, be aware of this and stick to spot exchanges because the risk is minimal unless you keep set your limit order on spot because they can also see it on the order book. I also recommend that you avoid scalping and instead focus on swing trading because you are looking for mid-term or weekly price action before placing a limit order.","876":"Now I've been in crypto since 2022.

You will see plenty of people who will buy bitcoin at the very peak, that's how it goes to peak, and you will see that they will all blame bitcoin being a scam after they see that peak, they will say it went up to fool people, and took the money, like there is some bitcoin organization that takes your money when you lose at trading.","878":"Now I've been in crypto since 2022.

This year Solana have reached 557.1% November 2021 Solana reached it's all time high $259,96. Do you guys think it's possible for Solana to reach a new all time high again? Very good prediction from BitMaxz. Like the above said it's due to new events and projects. Not just that, the upcoming Bitcoin event called block halving is also contributing to why Solana has increased its price for almost 2\/3 months now. But that's not the final price this year just my guess it would reach around $112 before the end of this month and it would drop slowly before the end of January. 23\/12-24: 1 SOL = $180,79 - DOWN 0.5% (24 HOURS) 05\/6-24: 1 SOL = $143,64 - DOWN 1.1% (24 HOURS) 05\/6-24: 1 SOL = $172,40 - UP 4.3% (24 HOURS) 14\/3-24: 1 SOL = $172.87 - UP 14% (24 HOURS) 31\/1-24: 1 SOL = $105,76 - UP 3.6% (24 HOURS)","882":"Did you check Solana price in 2021?

But neither you nor I can say out loud whether it will be a good future investment. However, in my opinion there may be some short-term bearish pressure on SOL prices in the near future, but the overall market sentiment is still bullish on Solana.

I have believed that majority of the altcoins that have been into its former ATH will have hard going back there. And with solana, it's way different from those altcoins that I know will have hard time going back there because its progress to be back there is fast.","889":"And to think it was 8 dollars during the FTX crisis.

In the world of cryptography currency everything is possible. I think in 2021 you speak of solana all time high, was also when bitcoin was also high and I think before bitcoin will climb it's ATH I believe other altcoins which had higher value and drop as bitcoin, will resurrect alongside with bitcoin. Checking from cryptographic analysis you would have noticed that all altcoin that was low in value have started gradually growing with bitcoin. Because bitcoin is there subsidiary and whatever happens to bitcoin also affects them. So I believe most altcoin will go back to its original state just as bitcoin is also going back.","897":"Previously doubted Solana when FTX experienced a decline because as far as I know FTX is a big holder of Solana and I thought they would withdraw their Solana to pay their creditors or customers.

I heard that the main cause of this price increase is the increasing adoption because many meme projects are present in their ecosystem, is that true? That\u2019s been a long time coming for TRON, as it didn\u2019t really benefit much from the last bull runs. IIRC, it pumped in 2017, but since then, it\u2019s struggled to keep up with the momentum of the following bull cycles. I think Justin Sun\u2019s marketing stunt, like a $6.2 million banana if you have read the news, might have played a role in this recent pump. Otherwise, I haven\u2019t seen any major news that would justify such a big jump. Unless, of course, we\u2019re already deep into altcoin season, where coins start pumping without needing much hype to get things going.","917":"I want to say congrats for all the TRON holders, we say a new ATH hitting $0.44\/coin, which is really nice, we are talking about +90% in the past 3 days. I remember last year or last two years that Tron was ten times lower than the all-time high. I was surprised to see it yesterday to have increased more than 10 times. But after the coin got to all-time high, it started to fall. It has fallen 1.25 times after it got to all-time high. But my disappointment about altcoins is how they will increase and fall back to where they increased from. Maybe Tron is going to be different but I am doubting it.","918":"Not many of us expected Tron to reach the new all-time high of 0.44 because the token has suffered a lot of attention lately because of the network's new exposure to the global market, and the market forces trying to push the token to the bearest minimum price in recent time's, this is somewhat a big lump up movement for Tron and as a matter of fact an unexpected price benchmark to someone like me I never did believe that Tron could reach such market height in this short period.","919":"There isn't news about TRON but it's pumping yesterday. Quite random but so is the BNB today that touches a new ATH at around $750. The top altcoins have been climbing since Nov this year, I guess it's not surprising anymore because this is a bull run already. * Tron has its own stablecoin in USD better known as USDT - TRC20 In short, every L1 token can potentially go 100X whenever there is stablecoin with them. This is also the reason why XRP has been going well recently because of their RLUSD that is to be launched next week.","920":"Tron made ATH, recently unexpected coins are reaching their highest levels, most of them are Asian coins, coins whose names were popular in the past. The same entries can be made to the projects on the Tron network, again, I would say evaluate your risk situation and then invest. The Tron network has some nice advantages, you can provide cheap transactions and it is fast. It is also necessary to follow coins like Bittorent and just right now.","921":"Tron is up 14% today, not bad at all. Bitcoin is consolidating are a big pump in November. Seems like it is the turn of some Alts to run right now. Obviously XRP is flying but lots of others are doing well. Don\u2019t forget to take profits though. I will be rotating some of my profit from Altcoins straight back into Bitcoin soon.","922":"Tron is up 14% today, not bad at all. Bitcoin is consolidating are a big pump in November.

While Bitcoin is taking a break, the altcoins have time to perform their own pump for the little time. Both BNB and other major altcoins are really surprising me with their price these few days. Whatever is pushing them, it's a good one. As for Tron, it's good to see it move this way, but I still consider Tron price to be undervalued if you ask me, considering what it has to offer.","923":"I considered TRX to be a stablecoin as there has been no upside over the past few years but this time it has unexpectedly reached ATH with its high peak. Do any of you believe that TRX can reach ATH? I didn't think so before.

Take your money and continue watching the market.","925":"I guess the reason why TRON performing so well is partly because justin sun's effort in cultivating the blockchain, he just doing non stop marketing and always deploying new things to the blockchain also following every trend to make it stays relevant. which definitely something I like about the project, compare it to other project around the same FDV where they just let their blockchain be and just stagnating with next to no innovation. moreover, it seems he also comitted to create more active ecosystem with the presence of USDD. but I expect BTC Dom to climb up fist before TRON making another rally to break new ATH because BTC just hit $102k .","926":"I considered TRX to be a stablecoin as there has been no upside over the past few years but this time it has unexpectedly reached ATH with its high peak.

Come 2024 and after following the price last year I feel TRX might well reach $0.50 in coming months. For those who don't know about Tron, let me give a short introduction. * Tron is fast, it's transactions are confirmed in less than 1 minute * Tron has smart contracts just line BNB or ETH * Tron has its own stablecoin in USD better known as USDT - TRC20 [1] Tron is fast, I agree with your point here but the biggest UPS (Unique Selling Proposition) about this blockchain is that it is never congested like others. [2] They have smart contracts as you said like BNB & ETH but they do not have an ecosystem big enough to counter both of them. [3] Sorry, Tron does not have their stablecoin but Tether uses Tron blockchain for its stablecoin which we know as USDT.","928":"Tron is a good coin and during the sudden rise of bitcoin gas fee, Ethereum gas fee. Tron was the alternative means of payment couples with LTC then before the birth of BNB if am not mistakenly, Trx is not just a short term project rather a long term project and anyone who is holding this coin should be more patient as Trx could likely hits 1$ to 4$ in couples of years to come. Reaching .44$ is a thing worth celebration as tron has been stagnated in few spots unlike LTC.","929":"So, the coin have it all, and used to be cheap as hell, but looks like the whales realize it's potential and decide to go big with it.

I use Tron only for transaction options because it is fast and costs less, while for long-term investment I have never done it, because from several years it has been quite slow in terms of increase, maybe in the current phase tron rose much higher, but not sure if it will touch $1. Often Tron transactions are only for gambling because of the low cost in terms of casino withdrawals as well, so this coin is always widely used for gamblers by depositing using tron.","932":"Well, this Tron\/Trx is also one of the ones I'm saving because there will also be a massive rally here in reality. What most people here don't expect, tron will do for sure. We also know that it helps us a lot in terms of doing transactions when we convert our earnings to crypto thru the Tron network, right? So I think it seems right that what I see is the possible price of this bull run that we are facing right now in Tron, actually, my expectations here are high, something that most of us here don't notice because they are busy with other crypto assets and meme coins with the hyped saw.","933":"I did not expect TRX to shoot up this much honestly. I always thought it was more of a stable coin. It also never had any problems and it seems like everyone in the community likes it. $1 TRON is in my opinion completely realistic.

It's one of my favorite blockchain, and very often used its to send USDT. I never expected that if TRX recorded new ATH in matter of days. Holy shit this bullrun is crazy as hell. It's very possible for Tron to reach $1 as long as it's growing at the current rate. It seems we're still at the early run of bullrun. I expect something crazy to happen with Tron soon.

It never reached that 3+ dollar all time high before and will not reach that again neither, and meanwhile all other coins keep getting higher peaks, so XRP falls in value and also falls in rankings as well. XRP may have done good now, but that was probably Ripple trying to make it alive, and they will stop buying it again, and we are going to see XRP stay about the same, or they are hoping that people would join the hype and buy some more and take it higher. I bet you that we will not see 3+ dollar during this bull run again, and the price will not move that much at all. So XRP is not something good to invest into.","966":"Well we still do have much time to go to get the all time high. It was 3.40 more then 7 years ago now it is trading for 1.05.

So if the problem with the SEC can be resolved, most likely XRP can have a fairly high opportunity to be able to rise again and exist in the market after all this time they are buried, and the price is still very possible to get by XRP, even though Garry Gensler resigned, We may not be able to ascertain how the case about XRP can be resolved.","969":"when the top is going to come in?

There are rumours the head of SEC Gary Gensler who is the main cause for holding XRP back is going to be resigning in the next few days which will be a massive relief and fresh start for XRP. Those saying it has not seen its all time high for many years , that\u2019s correct and it was only because of the law suit but now that\u2019s over it is free to rise again and it will for the remainder of this bull run. There are many predictions for XRP this bull run , some saying $20 or even $50. I do not think it will go that high but I do think $5-10 is possible this bull run which would be a great return from the $0.50 - $0.60 price range it had been at for the last few years. Those who have been hating XRP for the last few years are going to be shocked next year with how well it does.","971":"XRP might resume its rally to $2 in the future, kinda sad though I faded this coin when I was already accumulating it, for the sake of rotating to some emerging memes. but since the sentiment of XRP is getting good again anyway, I'm sure this bullrun will make XRP reach at least somewhere near its ATH. but I still pessimistic it can surpass its ATH, I don't believe all those speculations that predict that this coin gonna reach $20 and beyond. simply impossible with current hype.","972":"Since we all know that eventually XRP will be worth 10 thousand dollars a coin (many people have prophesied this) one of which was the guy who knew Trump would be shot in his ear and be unharmed over 3 months before it happened.

Until that happens, it will remain as a rumor. It's even having hard time breaking its former ATH on 2017 @ $3. At least MMCrypto in YouTube says that in one of his last videos and he, I believe, is quite a credible source. Who's this? if this is the source that you're talking about that you'll be dependent on your decision with your investment in XRP. You still need to make your own decision and it's not always good to source your decisions on these influencers.

Analysis from the Bitcoin veteran trader shows XRP price could break out and rally among bullish altcoins, including ETFSwap (ETFS), following BTC, creating a new all-time high of $89,000 in the crypto markets and igniting the 2024 crypto bull run. However, the Bitcoin veteran trader has also highlighted XRP price resistances and ongoing legal battles with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) as bearish factors that can limit XRP\u2019s potential to rally when compared to ETFSwap (ETFS).","978":"No content","979":"For the python language only, I am looking for an API that connects to a swap like raydium, and need to know what wallet to use (which wallets support all the tokens on these platforms, solfare?.)

Elon has a special motive by shilling Dogecoin. This is because he may still be holding Dogecoin. He has revealed that in 2022, he owned a bunch of Doge as a part of his assets along with Bitcoin. This means he may still be holding it till this time, and he is shilling it with the hope of pushing Doge's price to go up. Elon often does this to drive the demand in the market to buy his owned token and drive it up. I think shilling Doge will raise crypto users' trust in it, then encourage more people to put their money on it. it's a really a basic theory used by the influencer to pump his bag.

We do know that one of the most crucial or needed up thing is community support and recognition because not having this will really be pointless or useless.

Usually, such cross-border money transfers by classical methods have a commission of about 7%. DOGE also has a rather large fan club of celebrities, which includes Elon Musk, Mark Cuban and Snoop Dogg.

I see doge among the old coins that have been dumped for new coins that were created. People thought if bitcoin can get to all-time high next, that doge will surpass $0.7 but it is 7 times lower than the price now. Do not be surprised if a coin like doge will disappoint more in the next bull run and after. The coin has been dumped just like other old coins. You will notice that if you take a closer look at the market. I think dogecoin is like Tron trx currently because there's nothing much happening in the project no development or something else except for the use of payment purpose and it's cheaper, of course Doge is one of the oldest coin out there and lot of projects that was created same time has long gone, example, EOS and few other coin. I think investor are all done with such project and their interest now on another pump dump projects.","1020":"I think dogecoin is like Tron trx currently because there's nothing much happening in the project no development or something else except for the use of payment purpose and it's cheaper, of course Doge is one of the oldest coin out there and lot of projects that was created same time has long gone, example, EOS and few other coin.

We can expect nothing meaningful to be happening to the development of doge even decades into the future because I think people just like it the way it is, even without smart contract capability it's already good enough. on the other hand, the fact that doge is frequently used as a payment method in platform like bitpay hugely because adoption of doge coin as a payment has been there for a long time already. it's cheap and quite low in volatility compared to other alts because decentralized holders and huge market cap which means another layer of difficulty for any manipulator to manipulate the market and make the asset volatile. overall, it's still a meme coin, and the capability of being used as a payment I think is not something that's new, any coin, including memes, already have built-in capability to be used as a payment, it just depends on the parties involved in the transaction whether they accept it or not.","1022":"-snip- -snip- DOGE was conceived as a meme currency, but after 11 years of existence, the token is often used to pay for purchases. This is the conclusion reached by experts from Bloomberg. According to the publication, the average commission on the network is <$0.01, which is almost 80 times cheaper than in the BTC blockchain, and a Dogecoin transaction requires less than a minute. Usually, such cross-border money transfers by classical methods have a commission of about 7%. DOGE also has a rather large fan club of celebrities, which includes Elon Musk, Mark Cuban and Snoop Dogg. The fact that the token is not just a joke asset is evidenced, for example, by the initiative of the Dallas Mavericks team to introduce payment for tickets and goods in Dogecoin. The cryptocurrency is also accepted in Williamsburg Pizza, whose co-owner pointed out the \"virality\" of the token. In the BitPay app, Dogecoin managed to overtake XRP and USDC, taking 5th place, experts noted. \u201cAs time goes on, Dogecoin has become less of a memecoin and more of just a blank slate \u2013 one without much technological or idiosyncratic risk.

They all say that they are not just a meme coin and that they are more than a meme coin. But in the end, they are all the same. A meme coin that eventually has no further development and no real use cases. Doge coin might have low fees and fast transaction speed. But when everyone will start using it, I am pretty much sure the fees will go up and it will take hours for network to confirm transactions due to network congestion. And doge having those \"fan club of celebrities\" is another big issue. They can manipulate their followers to invest in something and then dump the profits on them.","1023":"DOGE was conceived as a meme currency, but after 11 years of existence, the token is often used to pay for purchases.

Quote According to the publication, the average commission on the network is <$0.01, which is almost 80 times cheaper than in the BTC blockchain, A normal bitcoin transaction costs about $0.07. Doge price is $0.10 while bitcoin is $60000. 'nough said. Quote and a Dogecoin transaction requires less than a minute. Wrong. Confirmation is a concept not just an arbitrary number. We call a transaction \"confirmed\" when it becomes irreversible. 1 confirmation on bitcoin blockchain has more security that majority of altcoins combined. Whereas 1 confirmation on Doge network has no security whatsoever. This is why exchanges require such high number of confirmation for weak networks such as Doge. Quote DOGE also has a rather large fan club of celebrities, which includes Elon Musk, Mark Cuban and Snoop Dogg.

I think the memecoin indicator can't be separated from Dogecoin (DOGE) considering how this coin was created & what it was created for, going back to the history lesson, Dogecoin (DOGE) was created by Billy Markus to mock Bitcoin (BTC) at that time, with no utility and no vision.

Having an own, working blockchain is a significant asset and advantage, as it can work as a platform for other apps. With Doginals, Doge has already made some steps in that direction, although Doginals is a quite bad protocol. There are also quite good synergies with Litecoin through the merged mining. That's why I don't understand why development of Doge is so slow. Doge had of course some updates even in recent times, as everybody can see in its Github repository. But it is still based on Bitcoin 0.6 or 0.7, has not seen neither Segwit nor Taproot, and thus is technologically quite outdated. Heck, they're currently discussing about implementing CSV, which in Bitcoin was added more than 8 years ago ... If they could at least rebase Doge to Bitcoin 0.20 or so, then I think the coin would be take much more seriously. With Segwit and Taproot also they could adopt all the new fancy Bitcoin technologies, from a modern token protocol like Taproot Assets or RGB to things like BitVM or Discreet Log Contracts ... A lot of much smaller altcoins like PPC have already adopted these technologies, so it is not easy to understand why Doge is still stagnant ...","1032":"I kinda like dogecoin because of its low cost transaction fee and the fact that it's just a popular coin that is promoting it self, it is not like some of this current pump and dump meme coins, at least dogecoin have a lot of investors and if we notice, we would see that almost every exchange is listing or have listed dogecoin on their own.

However, I believe that its recent price decline and the lack of substantial development within the project suggest that it may be struggling to maintain its relevance.

Dogecoin have served its purpose, I would calmly give you this little piece of advise, thoroughly go in for other projects because I don't see any promising future for Dogecoin in the market currently. Dogecoin happens to be categorized among those coins that have made their massive pumps in the market and for this particular project to hits the moon again will be difficult, remember there are existence of more promising projects in the market and we have the top whales investors that are present to make their gigantic amount of profits.","1046":"What did you think about the future of dogecoin?

Is it going to do well in the future? The reason why I'm saying this is because I'm holding dogecoin, did you think I should keep holding it? I'm not bullish on Dogecoin. It has increased in price more than I had expected. It would surely follow any bull or bear but the overall price of it might decay as time passes. There needs to be a significance or a use case for a coin to sustain it's price. The only significance doge has now are the occasional shill from Elon Musk. But if Elon Musk created a new coin or switched side to another coin, the dogecoin might not be able to sustain current price. The price inflation of Dogecoin is unnatural and it's better to invest on other meme coins that has more natural resistance.","1048":"What did you think about the future of dogecoin? Is it going to do well in the future? The reason why I'm saying this is because I'm holding dogecoin, did you think I should keep holding it? For me, Dogecoin will stay.

What I do know is that Dogecoin is the first meme coin and if the narrative in the next bull market remains inclined towards meme coin then it will surely pump. None of us can predict the price point or when will it happen as it is not that easy to predict the crypto market.","1050":"What did you think about the future of dogecoin? Is it going to do well in the future? The reason why I'm saying this is because I'm holding dogecoin, did you think I should keep holding it? Right now, you shouldn't hold it at least for the whole bull run. Sell it during the bull run and buy it again during the bear market. That for me is the best strategy that you can use if you are holding a coin especially now that we might be entering the bull market. DOGE has been the OG of meme coin so I'm excluding it for meme coins that I consider as \"SHITCOINS\". It being the first meme coin and being at the top for quite some time makes it a good coin to hold. Add also the fact that it has a huge community supporting it as well. I'm not holding DOGE for now and I don't even have a plan on buying it for the long term as well, but basing on the history, I guess it's still a good coin to hold for mid to long term.","1051":"What did you think about the future of dogecoin? Is it going to do well in the future? The reason why I'm saying this is because I'm holding dogecoin, did you think I should keep holding it? No one knows though, but considering that Dogecoin is the most popular memecoin in the market, that gives dogecoin an edge over every memecoin in the market today. I don't have a serious thing about memecoin but I'd give consideration with Dogecoin. I think you should keep track of the popularity, trading volume, and some news circulating around Dogecoin, that will give you an idea on what's gonna happen in the future as well as it's potential value.","1052":"What did you think about the future of dogecoin?

The reason why I'm saying this is because I'm holding dogecoin, did you think I should keep holding it? You shall not hold it if you are think that will not be profitable for you.

The reason why I'm saying this is because I'm holding dogecoin, did you think I should keep holding it? Dogecoin, being the first meme coin can't be underrated or overemphasized, and just like Bitcoin which is the pioneer of cryptocurrency, Dogecoin is the pioneer of meme coin. So as long as meme coins are still being mentioned in the crypto world, Dogecoin will continue to be relevant. And whether or not some meme coins cease to be mentioned in the crypto world again, Dogecoin will continue to be mentioned, that's the way I can picture it for now. But for it to perform significantly as it did in its initial days is not feasible anymore, this is not the time that we have only a meme coin or two, we have many of them now, so the money would be split in them all. The fact that it is a meme coin with a higher market capitalization equally means that the inflow may not be reflected so much in its price, which also means that, unlike the new meme coins with low market capitalization, it will not be giving such a huge multiples income anymore. Above all, Dogecoin is a good coin and will still remain a good coin in the future.

Quote The reason why I'm saying this is because I'm holding dogecoin, did you think I should keep holding it? I think it\u2019s important to keep checking how it\u2019s currently performing and act according to that instead of just trying to think about the future. You can analyze the market and base your decisions on historical trends. It might not be as accurate but it\u2019s better than trying to decide based on what you feel. Just remember that memecoins such as dogecoin no matter how good it is right now isn\u2019t typically good for long-term investment and has a potential to crash after some time.","1055":"What did you think about the future of dogecoin? Is it going to do well in the future? The reason why I'm saying this is because I'm holding dogecoin, did you think I should keep holding it? Why ask about the future of a coin that has been around for so long? This coin even continues to stay in the top 10 of coinmarketcap, maybe several times out of the top 10 but all major exchanges make this coin available in several trading pairs on their exchanges, with high trading volume. If the future you mean is about prices, then all coins will not be able to avoid decline, but so far Dogecoin has managed to rise even though it hasn't passed their last ATH several years ago, maybe this coin again needs a tweet from Elon like he did several years ago which is the main reason this coin rose significantly and make the holders get fantastic profits.","1056":"As long as Elon will keep tweeting about it then it has a future. Even before he started to talk about Doge it had little value but it still kept trading. I don\u2019t think we will visit those lows which we had before Elon. The fact that he might accept dogecoin as some form of payment for certain products or services is why it will always hold some value. Just keep in mind that it\u2019s being mined and the miner revenue is very high and if it pumps it probably won\u2019t hold that value for too long.","1057":"Well, Dogecoin hasn't been making any noise yet but considering the man behind it is Elon Musk who always promotes it, they are not gonna go down easily as the other meme coins that were only created to fool their investors mainly to pump and dump it whenever they acquired the right amount to abandon their project. Doge on the other hand, is secured but you need to consider that every altcoin is not like bitcoins so you better have a plan for the future on when you will sell those because there will come a time if Elon no longer promotes it, then its price will surely crash.","1058":"What did you think about the future of dogecoin? Is it going to do well in the future? The reason why I'm saying this is because I'm holding dogecoin, did you think I should keep holding it? Right now, you shouldn't hold it at least for the whole bull run. Sell it during the bull run and buy it again during the bear market.

What are your thoughts? Does ETH have a bad network design? If not, why? What do you think would be the best approach for scaling ETH (aside from centralized L2s)? Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. And that is why the Layer 2 solution was first created on the Ethereum network due to its scalability issue. They have added so many upgrades to the network that I cannot remember but those have not been effective.

A lot of new crypto projects are now using other blockchains that are cheaper, faster, and can handle congestion or they are using a layer 2 solution. the perk of being latecomer they can easily find the weak point that they can improve on in releasing the next iteration of the smart contract based blockchain but being the first ever smart contract blockchain as ethereum is that you just don't know what kind of problem gonna be appearing next that could possibly congest the blockchain. so can't really blame ethereum on falling short on certain capability. at the end of the day ethereum still got that advantage of matured ecosystem overall which many new blockchain can't imitate or come close to. hopefully next upgrade there will be many surprises that could help significantly in improving ethereum scalability.","1110":"Gas fees can often be too high & it\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s POS which makes me uncomfortable about its long term future.

That much can be deduced from The Merge. Ethereum switching from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake proved to be a move towards solving scalability issues as well as environmental concerns.

Ethereum, to be honest despite its many attempts in fixing their scalability issues, remain to have high gas fees which should be immediately addressed.","1112":"Ethereum, to be honest despite its many attempts in fixing their scalability issues, remain to have high gas fees which should be immediately addressed. I don't think so because ethereum is a decentralized blockchain network, which means it is not controlled by any single entity. It allows cryptocurrencies and decentralized apps to run on it. Directly editing or fixing Ethereum is not easy because it would go against its decentralized nature where no one has full control. Making big changes to Ethereum without proper consensus could disrupt its decentralization. So, addressing high gas fees or other issues should be done step-by-step, through planned upgrades that the entire Ethereum community agrees on, rather than sudden major edits that could break the system's decentralized design.","1113":"I fear for Ethereum because other competitors are indeed catching up to, the success of Solana and Basechain is a testimony to this, I don't like to talk the technical side because with real commitment fromt the team it can be resolved.

Ethereum would have been the second best cryptocurrency in the industry but I don't think so though it is the second in the market but people are investing in other coins more than Ethereum. And the element of Centralization is also there through the wallet. Ethereum MEW is sharing with other projects which is not good as a decentralized cryptocurrency project. If a project is decentralized then it has to separate itself from other projects with all ramifications. So from the onset when I see the wallet with other projects, I see it as a centralized project and not decentralized project. And that is one of the main project I detected in the Ethereum project.

Another thing is that its developers like Vitalik Buterin have so much influence on the coin which also makes it centralized. The coin is centralized to an extent. Exactly. Bitcoin never had an ICO. Even its creator Satoshi Nakamoto was anonymous. He left the project in the hands of the community. With ETH, it's all of the contrary. People are following Vitalik blindly instead of sticking with crypto's true ideals\/principles. ETH was centralized from the very beginning. But now it's worse with the PoS upgrade. As I've stated before, deploying and executing smart contracts on-chain is a terrible idea. The Blockchain wasn't designed to handle constant interactions\/computations per second. So-called \"decentralized applications\" will eventually clog the Blockchain network. Why not move it off-chain instead? Only put token transactions on-chain to help reduce network congestion. Don't expect ETH developers to fix this, especially when it's not in their best interests to do so. I'm afraid on-chain gas fees will remain high for as long as ETH lives. At least, we have plenty of options to choose from.","1118":"I fear for Ethereum because other competitors are indeed catching up to, the success of Solana and Basechain is a testimony to this, I don't like to talk the technical side because with real commitment fromt the team it can be resolved.

Exchanges are only obligated to do just one main job and that's simple, making trades simple and smooth running.

However as we're concerned with the project, we should also consider the high gas fee and become more curious because it makes us spend extra because everyone would be so bend to see the enormous profits.","1119":"ETH's design was a bad idea from the start. Executing turing-complete smart contracts on-chain, adds undesired network bloat. The Blockchain wasn't designed to handle a large number of interactions per second. Vitalik and team should've separated contract deployment and execution from the main Ethereum blockchain. In other words, smart contracts will run off-chain, while ordinary transactions will run on-chain. Avalanche's 3-layer network design is the best way for scaling. For those unaware, \"turing-completeness\" means being able to \"solve any complex computation problem if provided with enough memory and time\". What are your thoughts? Does ETH have a bad network design? If not, why? What do you think would be the best approach for scaling ETH (aside from centralized L2s)? Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ETH was actually launched so that the altcoins market can compete with BTC market but the major problem that were faced was congestion and then we see that chains like SOL come into play where they solved the issues that were faced in ETH. Now it's time that either ETH upgrade itself utpo a certain extent otherwise SOL will take over the chain. These two are in a tussle and they both are very much in market due to continuous upgrades.","1120":"I fear for Ethereum because other competitors are indeed catching up to, the success of Solana and Basechain is a testimony to this, I don't like to talk the technical side because with real commitment fromt the team it can be resolved.

I think it might only be a matter of time before ethereum gets surpassed by another altcoin. Though I am not sure about memecoins being the one to do it. Solana is doing really good so we\u2019d have to keep an eye on it to check whether it can maintain its current status or even grow more. One thing for sure though if solana becomes more successful and valuable than ethereum, it will legitimize memecoins and we will see more of them in the field.","1121":"What are your thoughts?

It doesn't have a bad network design. How can you call blame the first smartcontract blockchain as a blockchain that has bad network design? Does it make sense? Why don avalanche team release their blockchain before ethereum? Ethereum is an old blockchain, and it has also become the first smartcontract blockchain. I value ethereum not only as a blockchain but it acted as experimental technology before the development of blockchain is growing even faster like this time. If not, why? What do you think would be the best approach for scaling ETH (aside from centralized L2s)? Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. L2 is already the best solution for this. I meant we shall not be going through forking the blockchain anytime. Vitalik has introduced an update for ethereum blockchain to cut L2 fees. Although i must admit ethereum fees is so damn high but it can go so low once you have bridged your ethereum to the L2 blockchain.","1122":"here's one of the things said by a guy who supported ETH being a validator for years. and he is not happy with what is happening in the ENS and all the rest of the tokens that used the Etherchain. it's been happening for years already and we can see it since the time Tether got into most of the L1 projects but are using eth blockchain. users are just up to making profits and not for decentralization. Quote I\u2019m an Ethereum node validator mining for over 1100 days! Why because I saw the connections with TradFi years ago and so I took a bet on ETH and wanted to support what they called ETH2. But over the years, I\u2019ve been seeing things which I disagree with. LSD\u2019s, restaking, and sadly this extreme bias with ENS. These conflicts of interest are fuelled solely by their investments and the price of tokens! It\u2019s an attempt for an inner circle to hold a monopoly over certain services. The @ethereum foundation recently suggested they need to work on these financial conflicts of interest. The problem is, imho they are empty words. I\u2019m not sure they can actually put their biases aside because they\u2019re so deeply intertwined with these tokens financially they are ethically and morally corrupt. They can\u2019t deny it because they are literally saying these things publicly, we have the receipts recorded in podcasts hosted on the Internet for everyone to hear and see. And for this reason I believe in a multi chain paradigm. Because if you\u2019re going to sit on a high horse with such arrogance believing that nothing can compete due to a first mover advantage. To me that is a sign of lackadaisical leadership with their eyes off the ball, bellies already too fat from feeding off the ERC-20 trough for too long. @IOHK_Charles has made a loud and clear message to @BanklessHQ that if they wish to mock their research and technology at least have the balls to go and do it in person to their communities faces, instead of hiding behind a computer screen with the Ethereum army backing them up.

While several other projects emerged in that wave, USDD on Tron remains one of the few notable examples [1]. Initially, USDD was designed with a diversified reserve pool, including both Bitcoin and TRX. However, recent withdrawals of nearly 12,000 BTC have left the stablecoin solely backed by TRX. This shift has raised concerns among the crypto community about the potential for a black swan event, particularly as the market nears a potential uptrend and altcoin season [2]. Although USDD's market cap is currently lower than UST's was before its collapse (750M USD << 18B USD), the interconnectedness of the Tron ecosystem could lead to broader implications. The potential failure of USDD could have a ripple effect, even affecting the liquidity of TRC-20 USDT. While I personally avoid USDD, my holdings of USDT on Tron make me wary of these risks. As a precaution, I might explore USDC as a safer alternative. The absence of community involvement in the Tron DAO Reserve's decision-making process contradicts the principles of decentralized governance. Given Justin Sun's track record of unreliability, I am not surprised by this outcome. The lack of trust in the project's leadership has dissuaded me from investing in TRX, even during its extended period of price recovery. I want to know your opinion on this issue: Do you believe in the future of algorithmic stablecoins? Are you still using USDD or other algorithmic stablecoins? If it collapses, could USDD negatively impact the entire crypto market?

However, the platform's development trajectory remains robust, with significant strides being made in preparation for the transformative Hydra and Chang hard forks. As a Cardano sidechain, Hydra processes numerous transactions off-chain, significantly enhancing the mainnet's performance. This scalability improvement positions Cardano to accommodate a broader user base and diverse use cases, such as DeFi and supply chain logistics. By introducing stake delegation to stake pools, the Chang hard fork aims to distribute the control of the Cardano network more widely. This increased decentralization empowers a larger portion of the community to participate in the network's governance. \u201cAfter Chang Hard Fork and Hydra, Cardano will be unstoppable. Highest decentralization and unlimited transaction speed while also having one of the highest security,\u201d Cardano advocate Ssebi stated. [1] Cardano has historically shown resilience to congestion, aside from notable exceptions like the SundaeSwap launch [2]. While increased decentralization is a long-term goal, the imminent implementation of Layer-2 Hydra is the primary catalyst for renewed investor interest in ADA. This scaling solution aligns with the industry's current focus and is poised to significantly enhance the network's capacity. This positive development could bolster Cardano's user base, providing support for ADA price. Ideally, this support would prevent a return to the 0.25 USD low and potentially propel ADA to new ATH, perhaps reaching the 7 USD mark this season. I would like to know your views on this: Are you holding ADA in your balance? Do you expect a positive impact from Hydra & Chang on ADA price? Can Hydra & Chang make Cardano great again this season?

I feel that soon, meme coin might thrive on TON network instead of Ethereum network, I might be wrong though but I know that those meme project prefer a blockchain with low gas fee, it's a strategy to make investment easier for their investors.

This excitement was fueled by the booming AI and restaking trends, which revitalized the crypto market. However, the post-halving re-accumulation phase, similar to past cycles, has dampened spirits with some investors growing bored and skeptical. Despite recent negative news from Mt.Gox and the German government, there's a bright spot for Ethereum. The timeline for the ETF's launch is expected to be swift, with trading likely to commence as early as Tuesday. Analysts predict this spot ETH ETF could be a game-changer, attracting significant investments to Ethereum. Leading exchange Gemini estimates potential inflows of up to 5B USD within the first 6 months. This surge in investment could significantly benefit the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially accelerating innovation and development. [1] This spot ETH ETF is expected to trigger a chain reaction of positive outcomes: 1. A more bullish sentiment within the crypto community. 2. An influx of new investors and capital into the market. 3. The creation of new spot ETFs for various Proof-of-Stake tokens, with SOL and XRP being the frontrunners. 4. A potential altseason marked by widespread price increases across the cryptocurrency market, culminating in a substantial rise in the total market cap. The introduction of a spot ETH ETF alongside a spot BTC ETF presents a strategic opportunity to attract traditional investors to the crypto market. This could be a turning point, accelerating the transition from the current re-accumulation phase to a sustained period of growth.

The same might be happening here because once those ETF inflows start coming in for ETH, it would mean more buy price on ETH.

Hopefully it can help market to be bullish in some way, since with the news of Mt.Gox market has been engulfed with fear, definitely need a good news right now. 3.

It depends on how deeply interested institutional investors are in Ethereum. Capital inflows between the spot BTC ETFs and the spot ETH ETFs will tell you which is most successful. I've read about many companies filing for spot ETH ETFs, so it looks like things are going to be bright for the cryptocurrency. Personally, I hold less than 1 ETH in my portfolio. I'm planning to buy more before the next \"pump\". It's likely altcoins will go to the moon, once ETH spot ETFs get the \"green light\" from the SEC. Especially ETH-based tokens (ERC-20).

Do you have high expectation for the positive impact that spot ETH ETF can bring to the crypto market? Are you holding ETH and waiting for ETH price increase after this news? 1. I don't think ETH ETF will be as successful as bitcoin. The reason is clear. Ethereum can't leave bitcoin's movement. As long as Ethereum keeps following it, it will be stuck. Things may change if the ETF buys hundreds of thousands of Ethereum from the market. But, the impact may not be as big as bitcoin's did. Again, Ethereum's deflation is also getting slower. This is due to the lack of transactions in the blockchain. This is also inflating the total supply of Ethereum itself. It's very hard to say Ethereum's price will be surge more than 50% like what Bitcoin did. Ethereum's trend still follows bitcoin. 2. I don't expect much from ETH ETFs. And again, this can't have a huge impact on all crypto. Ethereum is the only coin that will benefit from the launch of ETH ETF. This is pretty much the same as bitcoin's case. Look at how altcoins are always getting eaten by bitcoin. People are slowly moving their money only to the BTC, and probably ETH ETF makes it worst. The demand for altcoins will be less. 3. I've sold all of Ethereum at the peak price. Buy the rumors and sell for the news. I don't mind how big Ethereum will increase, and i can still enter the party through future trades. It's very obvious people will sell their Ethereum after the launch of ETH ETF.","1190":"I would like to know your opinion on this issue: Do you think the spot ETH ETF will be as successful as the spot BTC ETF? Do you have high expectation for the positive impact that spot ETH ETF can bring to the crypto market? Are you holding ETH and waiting for ETH price increase after this news? ETH doesn't have to have an ETF as successful as BTC, because lets face it Bitcoins name is a lot bigger for the group that would fail to buy btc themselves and only use an ETF to get it. So, obviously it will not get something that big, and that is understandable and normal. However, we need to realize that it is not going to be something that will take a while, we just need to make sure that we deal with something that is going to be fine, and that is the most important part. I personally believe that if we give it some time, we are going to deal with something that will take a while. The issue here is that we are going to deal with a lot of people who will face tough situations, and not really deal with anything that will give us any benefit at all. I think if you see ETH as something of a \"king of alts\" then you will realize that, we have a chance, it could be small, but there could be some altseason that happens, like maybe 100% max, not those 10x types, but it will still be good. This is why I believe that we should keep our hopes high, lets wait for it to happen and be ready for an increase, at worst case it can't cause the alt prices to go down, so it is not going to be too bad at all.","1191":"After years of regulatory pushback and countless amended registration filings, spot Ether Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are finally hitting the market.

But if we look at Bitcoin's ETF approval, the same thing happen, it takes month before we suddenly see the positive effect on this news on the market and this is what it triggers a new all time high prior to the halving. So it's better to just continue what we have done before, buy and accumulate and then HODL, simply as that. If by chance the Ethereum market catches up with the hype of ETF then maybe we will see a huge spike in the price. And we are in the bull run season as well, so most likely we will see the price slowly increasing and who knows, maybe next year not just Ethereum, but the whole crypto market is enjoying a good run and majority of the coins are hitting their new all time high.","1193":"No content","1194":"I have been on the look for a very cheap and fast way to do some cross-bridging between Ethereum and Layer 2 networks without using risky third-party bridges?","1195":"I would suggest the gateways or bridges from Optimism or Arbitrum, they are supported, well-known and provide secure ways to do what you need.","1196":"I have been on the look for a very cheap and fast way to do some cross-bridging between Ethereum and Layer 2 networks without using risky third-party bridges?

The only significant things I've seen pro shitcoin traders look out for is locked liquidity and if there are holders with a large percentage of the total supply. If there is, then it's a no no. Also, if liquidity isn't locked too. And what is the minimum amount to start trading these solana meme coins? I haven't tried it yet but you can do with as low as $2. I have tried personally. I haven't tried $1 or less. Another important think to note is that you can only use such amount on solana. On Ethereum Mainnet, it won't work because gas fee is usually above $1. I know that in exchanges like mexc, bitget and I know I can start trading with less than 1dollar...but Depends on the exchange. No two exchanges are the same. You have to check their FAQ and terms of service too. On binance, your trade needs to be a minimum of $10 on either side (buyer or seller) if I remember correctly. Can I also start trading these altcoins that you find in dexscreener for less than 1 dollar? On Solana, looks possible to me. Like I already said, I have only tried a trade with $2 and above. The one time the amount traded was $2 was because the price of the memecoin had dropped over 98% and the $2 was the only piece I could salvage. And is it possible to short these solana meme coins? Only if an exchange lists them on perpetual futures. MeXC and Bybit are some of the exchanges that lists memecoins on futures from time to time.","1205":"Hi what filters do you use in dexscreener to find potential rugpulls or detect coins that are not a good option to scalp? No filters, just try to use your feeling, and try to look at the contract first, but play hit and run. if you already get decent profit then go out. And what is the minimum amount to start trading these solana meme coins? No minimum amounts but i recommended you around 10 -20 bucks. I know that in exchanges like mexc, bitget and I know I can start trading with less than 1dollar...but Can I also start trading these altcoins that you find in dexscreener for less than 1 dollar? CEX will not allow you to trade less than 1 dollar, there will always be a minimum amounts to be traded, but dex will allow you to do that. And is it possible to short these solana meme coins? Impossible since dex was not supporting the prepetual or futures market for the new tokens issued in the blockchain.","1206":"Always use the intel feature in dexscreener like this one below it's really useful to find out whether the contract doesn't comply with the standard protocol and also find out whether there's backdoor in the contract where the devs can use to rugpull or to tinker around with the contract code. other than that, just see the token contract in the blockchain explorer such as solscan if the meme coin is in sol and see the token holder section, if there are some addresses that holds big percentage of the total supply, big chance it is a malicious meme coin probably gonna rugpull you. there's no minimum generally for a trade in DEX but always judge whether it's worth it by seeing the transaction fee. in regard to shorting these meme coin, if the market cap is low and not popular, forget it, no perpetual platform will be interested to create perpetual market for these, so don't bother but if the meme coin you're trading is big and famous enough just check it out in various dex, for example in jupiter => https:\/\/solana.com\/ecosystem\/jupiteraggregator","1207":"There is a bunch of checker out there you can simply google it by using honeypot checker and found the token is honeypot or not.

It is worth noting that Kabosu died as a result of leukemia, which he had been suffering from for two years. Kabosu was indeed the most famous dog among the dog breeds, whose image was used in popular commercial advertisements and in the DogeCoin logo, which is considered the queen of meme coins and which won the admiration and support of Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, and other businessmen and artists.

In 2020, the photo of Kabosu was popular meme with the word DOGE which inspired the creators of Dogecoin who took both the picture as logo and the word Doge as name for the first memecoin.

But why would you give 80% to your online gaming platform members and keep only 20% for yourself? Is this an act of generosity, or is it an indirect promotional strategy? In any case, if you have a long-term vision and aspire to continue developing your platform and making it integrated, and if you lack sufficient experience and have the capital, you can search for legitimate companies and developers to implement your request.","1281":"Hi, I wonder how can i do this.

With the click of a button, he acquired a staggering 10,000,000 Dogecoins, each valued at the humble price of $0.0002. This digital currency, adorned with the face of a Shiba Inu, was not just a meme but a beacon of potential for Michael. As the years rolled by, the value of Dogecoin fluctuated wildly, dancing to the tune of market sentiment and internet hype. Meanwhile, Michael's life unfolded in parallel\u2014a tapestry of routine and dreams, with his digital treasure locked away behind a forgotten password. His attempts to regain access were akin to a knight trying to reclaim a kingdom lost to time, with each failed attempt in 2015 and 2018 deepening the lore of his quest. The wheel of fortune turned once more in January 2024, when a serendipitous YouTube algorithm presented Michael with a video from The Crypto Retriever. This group of digital locksmiths specialized in reuniting owners with their lost crypto fortunes. With hope rekindled, Michael embarked on a meticulous investigation into their reputation, combing through forums and testimonials. Convinced of their expertise, he initiated contact through the encrypted channels of Telegram. Michael entrusted The Crypto Retriever with the fragments of his memory\u2014password hints and wallet IDs, like pieces of a map to buried treasure. The team set sail into the binary seas, navigating through algorithms and encryptions. After what felt like an eternity but was only two weeks, they emerged victorious, the password in hand. The moment of truth arrived. Michael, with bated breath, watched as The Crypto Retriever remotely navigated his computer. The digital vault that was dogechain.info unfurled before them, revealing a hoard of $1.6 million\u2014a fortune that had silently burgeoned as the world above continued its hustle and bustle. Tears of joy and disbelief streamed down Michael's face as he realized the magnitude of his newfound wealth. The weight of financial burdens lifted, and the doors to new possibilities flung open. In a grand gesture of gratitude, he awarded The Crypto Retriever with a quarter of his digital gold, a fitting tribute to their skill and perseverance. Michael Cowin Nakamoto's tale is one of modern-day alchemy, where forgotten digital coins transformed into a life-altering bounty. It's a narrative that echoes across the digital realm, reminding us that sometimes, the keys to our future lie in the enigmatic past.

We've got familiar names like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana making waves, but let's talk about smaller gems like ATOR. Many investors are going to naturally want to look for other things, the \u201cnext bitcoin\u201d if you will. This is why we should start expecting for altcoins to have a massive uptrend so we must always be on our toes. Quote Here's my question: What do you think is most important for a project like this to succeed long-term - keeping your data private, being able to connect securely, or something else? To me security is always the top priority when looking for projects. This alongside functionality will surely help a project succeed. If the users have found reason to always use and return to the project, then long-term success can be guaranteed. Quote Which other projects are on your watchlist?

This is my first time seeing this kind of project and totally new for me, as far as my first notice, this is a new blockchain network that is very common right now. Since ew are talking about prices here, fundamental of this project seems still unknown to everybody, it's still new.","1299":"Other than ETH, I have high hopes from meme coins. The general Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe and likes as well the new hotcakes like BOME, MEW and Dogwifhat. I am also bullish on Solana. Solana would be the prominent tool to carry the success of next bull run. If Solana network holds, the pump would be huge.

I will still not see it as their bull run because I have seen Ethereum hit $4,678.5 and that was the all time high for it.

And seeing the density of projects and the seriousness of developers I chose solana for a backup option. I think even though the dump is far away these 2 networks are suitable for the long term.

Your cautious approach is a good strategy to safeguard your funds, however as far as I know there are not widely know revoking tools available on Solana network as on Ethereum based networks. Solana\"s network is different compared to Ethereum, and and can impact the development of such tools. The best way to protect your wallet from being drained, the primary focus should be on verifying trust worthiness of dApps before connecting your wallet. is to ensure the dApps are tru worthy before connecting your wallet.","1318":"As far as I understand Solana Dapps risk is a bit high in the age of internet scams are increasing here.

Taking precautions will reduce the risk.","1319":"if a blockchain requires approval for token spending for smart contract to spend your token on behalf of you big fat chance it will also require you revoking approval for security purpose I think solana is no different, if i remember correctly when using reputed dapps from solana they also requires you to give approval of spending on behalf of you so that they can execute their smart contract method like jup if im not mistaken so yes it requires you to revoke but honestly you will be fine if you never give approval of infinite amount and as long as you only interact with reputed dapps you're gonna be fine. people are losing money because their wallet drained through this approval, giving some random malicious contract code spending authority on behalf of them and then the contract drained the wallet of all token. unfortunately this kind of mechanism needed in any dapps that requires to control your token so they can do things.","1320":"It\u2019s important to understand that all Dapps have their risks.

The only thing is that if you feel like you should revoke your address, then you should, because threatening sites could have been used with or without one's notice. So we have to be very careful with whatever we do with the internet. Even though it's claimed that a particular network is free from bugs, it's still not a guarantee.","1322":"i can see this is already dragging the price down. i saw another post on credit about some dapps causing this so it's not going to be farfetched to see your tokens drained. i have the feeling the dev is not responding and that this is part of the fud. to sell or not to sell? that is the question. only a few days later and having will be here. and so there is time to decide whether to go all in BTC and stick to SOL. different POV will likely make us confuse but it's never wrong to stick to BTC.","1323":"[....]What I would like to know is if interacting with different dapps on Solana blockchain can easily get your wallet drained like it has been the case with the like of ETH, BSC\u2026 Your wallet won't be drained unless you allow these Dapps to do so.

You may not like the word meme coins, but the potential of SHIB is that you are not that passionate, who knows, you never know that it will suddenly give you a profit in the end.","1344":"A trading competition is happening at a local exchange in my country. The exchange is a trusted and established one and I have zero doubt about the $SHIB tokens I can receive as a reward in my Shiba Inu exchange wallet. I have been using this exchange since 2018 without any major issues, so you can understand the amount of confidence I have in them. I mostly invest in Bitcoin, and sometimes in important altcoins. However, I don't believe in the concept of meme coins and don't pursue them. I'm interested in knowing whether I should continue holding onto my current tokens until the next bull run, or if I should sell them to buy Bitcoin or other altcoins. I would appreciate a piece of good advice from the community. Since this is free money that you received and the amount is not very large, it makes more sense to me to hold that Shiba and see if we can see it making a big movement during the bull run. After all it is not as if you have anything to lose by taking this decision, as currently that amount represents only 25.15 dollars and you got them for free anyway, so this is one of the few instances in which it makes sense to roll the dice and take a risk you may not take otherwise.","1345":"SHIB is able to hold it's ground and I think that it's one of many meme coins out there that will have a staying power and I believe that you're going to get more out of it but seeing how much it is, I think you should just go for it and sell it I guess, most meme coins anyway needs you to have invested early on to get the most out of them and even if you hold on to it for a really long time, it's not worth the patience. What I want you to change though is how you look at meme coins, as much as they're useless and worthless it is, you have to consider that they've got the potential to be able to put someone in a favorable financial status because there's too many people that have found success with meme coins that I don't like the idea of discarding them or just leaving them on the sidelines, maybe it's just my bias talking but I believe that I've got a point when I say that someone shouldn't just not consider them as an investment.","1346":"1,000,000 SHIB is approximately $25 which isn\u2019t really a lot of money unless you live in a third world country. If I was you I would HODL them. We are very early in the bull run, you could probably x 10 that money simply by holding for 12 months or so. That's what I was thinking. At the casino\/bookie place I occasionally use I get Shiba sometime in drops or other rewards, all the time like 50k-100k in shib. It sounds a lot but isn't, haha. I just keep it and see if it goes somewhere. Exchanging it to something else just costs fees, so I rather speculate for it to go to the moon. And if it doesn't it's a also fine, I didn't pay anything for it.","1347":"No content","1348":"Scrolling through the streets of X, I saw something captivating. A new meme in the Solana chain called EPIK, here are some details about it; \ud83d\ude80846M total supply \ud83d\ude0e low mcap 34.5M \ud83e\udd3724hr trading vol of over 17m.. With this features, is it convincing enough for you as a memecoin?","1349":"There are so many such projects in the solan ecosystem and all of them will die in a year. I understand that you only provided information, but it has always been very dangerous to invest in such projects. I usually hear a lot of news about crypto users losing their money in such projects.","1350":"Do you think that Twitter followers are an indication of a good project? These followers are sold for tens of dollars on the black market, and even activity and advertising campaigns can be faked. Solana meme token is a perfect example of a token that wants to seize the opportunity, as their strategy will depend on a small supply quantity, a large closed quantity, sufficient liquidity to pump up the price, intense promotion on social media and then the price explodes upward, many investors come and suddenly everything disappears.","1351":"Are you familiar with the story of Icarus and how he flew a little too close to the sun? Well Solana might do just that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually going to cost them the main solana coin but they are just releasing SO MANY memecoins and everyone is understandably hyping it with it being a part of the solana ecosystem. But at this point, I am seeing too much quantity and not much quality. There\u2019s a huge chance that these \u2018new sensations\u2019 are just going to die in a few months.","1352":"So many meme coins on Solana are making waves but they are good on initial hype after a few months, a new meme will come along with a better promise from previous memes in the market, and the old memes will die a natural death. Let's admit it, these memes are being looked at as profit generators by whales at the expense of small investors or newbies, they have huge funding to create FOMO in the market So if you're going to ride in meme games be sure you know when to get in and when to get out because the memes trend is pump and dumps and whales' playing field.","1353":"EPIK has the potential to make some amazing wave in the market i'll surely ape in some when i get some time to look for entry Anything is possible in the crypto market, you'll never really know which new project will fly and still be relevant in the market and gain investors trust, so just carry out research and take chances from the multitude of them, because you're going to be gambling your funds, simple reason being that we have more scam projects than legit ones. I'm not familiar with this EPIC memecoins, but if you feel confident about investing in it, by all means do so, afterall it's your money, but remember to invest the amount that you can afford to loose.","1354":"In the end, memecoin will die when the hype is over, now many may be consumed by the FOMO of memecoin solana network but this is not the best way of investing for you or anyone, this is a shitcoin that will not be valuable later. Are you showing 6K X followers? This is irrelevant, followers can be bought anywhere you know if it's bots or humans that follow? Make sure no one takes a risk on a relatively new meme coin.","1355":"It might well be the next Solana meme coin sensation as long as it is backed by whales and investors who create an unnatural or fake demand on the coin by pumping it and creating a fear of missing out among investors who are looking to make profits. This has been the story of so many meme coins in the market, new ones coming in to get pumped while old ones dying and they repeat the cycle.","1356":"It is true that EPIK is currently experiencing a very significant increase or is booming. In my opinion, if you like investing in memecoins that are growing, EPIK is the right choice, but you must have a strong mentality to accept the consequences of the investment you make. with memecoin, because memecoin can give an extraordinary explosion, memecoin can go down drastically and can also rise many times.","1357":"There are so many such projects in the solan ecosystem and all of them will die in a year. I understand that you only provided information, but it has always been very dangerous to invest in such projects. I usually hear a lot of news about crypto users losing their money in such projects. Exactly and all those total supply and market capitalization in most time are just formulation and not reality. And the way I understand those memecoins, there are some groups of friends would come together and raise that amount and deposit it to deceive people to invest and when they have taken enough money from victims then the project would have issues and die off. No crypto project will produce another coin that will come and pass it in the space. And what I mean is that no memecoin that is in Solana network that will come and over take Solana again instead it die as you said. Be wise when dealing with this memecoins and airdrops because most of them are for trap to lure people to invest.","1358":"This is the TEH EPIK DUCK coin. I saw its name on Bitget's official account on X several days ago [1], and I believe it was listed. Trading opened on this exchange platform on April 18 at 11:00 AM (UTC). As for me, even if it were listed on T1 exchanges, I do not recognize these meme coins as a real and safe investment. Although many people seek profit in the first place through their investments, not everyone sees the level of risk associated with these meme coins. Even if its price reaches $0.044, there's no guarantee it will return to that level, continue to rise, get listed on more CEX platforms, or its team won't abandon it and create another coin because creating a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, creating a website, and creating accounts for its community and simple designs is not difficult or costly.","1359":"There are so many such projects in the solan ecosystem and all of them will die in a year.

Meme coins are useless and they are just a way for greedy and unscrupulous developers to scam whoever that trust them. Now the developers may come up with a bunch of excuses about why their projects fail, but it does not matter, what matters is that the majority of those that decide to trust them will lose their money and will have no way to ever recover it.","1360":"It is true that EPIK is currently experiencing a very significant increase or is booming.

You've said it all, mate. And thanks for the tip. I snagged it on Bitget Memezone... Here's hoping for market stability to help memecoins start gaining ground again","1361":"It is easy to gets bots as followers on X by paying some money. Followers doesn't mean anything unless they are active on X. Solana is now full of these meme coins after the success of a few. Not all of them will be able to replicate the same success. I am not against any meme coin but it is better to take more caution than before in investing in these coins.","1362":"In the end, memecoin will die when the hype is over, now many may be consumed by the FOMO of memecoin solana network but this is not the best way of investing for you or anyone, this is a shitcoin that will not be valuable later. I don't think Dogecoin will disappear anytime soon, and since it will exist, its success is a sign that more memecoins will try to take advantage of this success to claim that it may have future value. Memecoin will remain with us for a while, but every once in a while a currency will appear claiming to be the best alternative to Dogecoin and disappear within months.","1363":"Do you think that Twitter followers are an indication of a good project?

When I do a Twitter analyze, I see which famous people in the crypto world are subscribed to this project. If there are no such people or a few, that's the first red flag. All projects use white and black methods of scoring their social media accounts, so the number of followers is not an important criterion.","1364":"Scrolling through the streets of X, I saw something captivating.

Believing that doge will not just disappear, the fact that Elon Musk is behind it, the oldest meme will still be the elder for other memes. In the meantime the new memes are just trying to hype up the many enthusiasts on this one, regardless they hope to be like WIF, SHIBA or PEPE in the future but I say bullish if there are more memes like that. I think memecoins will continue to come and go, in the sense that the old ones come out rugpull, then come again.","1367":"These type of new meme projects that hype people are not stuff you should be investing into. Maybe there is a small chance that you could do well with it at the time, but that doesn't mean that you are going to do all that well, sometimes you could do well enough and sometimes you could do terrible with it as well. I believe that we are not going to be doing that well if we are not careful. This type of meme projects will end up making us lose a lot more money, and we should not be doing anything big with our investment into these type of silly stuff. If you really want to make as much money as you want, then you are going to end up with a result that is not going to be all that simple in the end.","1368":"No content","1369":"This article is asking if content creators will join. I reckon we cannot be certain if content creators will join, however, we can very much be certain that the customers in the cryptospace have their payment always ready in their wallets and already waiting for the content creators hehehehe. The adult content platform OnlyFans, to crypto fans, seems like a Web2 company ripe for disruption. The platform charges a 20% fee on all creator earnings, generating billions in revenue for the company. A creator's content, followers, and earnings, though, are locked to the platform, meaning it's tough to leave once you've built a following. Plus, there was that time banks nearly forced OnlyFans to ban all adult content on the platform, according to its CEO. Enter Only1, which today announced a $1.3 million strategic raise led by Newman Group to create an OnlyFans-type adult content platform on Solana, bringing its total fundraising to $4.8 million.

Digital collectibles actually seem to be good idea in this, but in no way i can see any purpose or justification for the token.

Behind Doge there is Elon Musk as an influence on this meme coin at least by recently changing the twitter logo to doge it is a sign that he loves the dogecoin meme coin, behind all that it would be very believable if one more tweet from Elon musk then he is creating hype for his coin. The possibility of doge coins can explode again, but don't be too trusting anything can happen later.","1397":"If DOGE reflects the future of cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies have no future.

I've used it a few times and I can say that it's speed and ease of transaction confirmation is commendable.

It's like gamestop rise but daily and on different coins. Dogecoin is still a good coin to predict for swings as it's one of the coin of interest of iconic billionaire Elon Musk. Any further xts from him anytime, the coin would jump a 20%.","1402":"DOGE was a meme Coin at the earliest stage most people didn't invest on the Coin, before was adopted by the Elon musk, using DOGE Coin as a means of payment in his company, that makes DOGE Coin price pump unbelievable, that is still have future potential in the cryptocurrency industries.","1403":"DOGE was a meme Coin at the earliest stage most people didn't invest on the Coin, before was adopted by the Elon musk, using DOGE Coin as a means of payment in his company, that makes DOGE Coin price pump unbelievable, that is still have future potential in the cryptocurrency industries.

I am good with one meme coin in the market, creating more will diversify the money that is supposed to go to other projects with real use base backgrounds. Or, are we just going to waste our time and money joking around with this type of coin which we all know will not really help the technology of the future? They are just there for the hype and for whales to make money after manipulating it.","1405":"DOGE\u2019s rise can be seen as both a sign of the future of cryptocurrencies & a fleeting internet meme phenomenon.

Introducing MNN, a cutting-edge digital currency that promises to revolutionize the industry with its innovative features and ambitious vision. The Rise of Zephyr (ZEPH) Before delving into MNN's potential, it's essential to understand the significance of Zephyr (ZEPH). Launched in 2020, ZEPH quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, thanks to its robust security measures, fast transaction speeds, and scalability. ZEPH's market capitalization has soared, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world. Challenging the Status Quo: MNN's Bold Approach MNN, short for \"Monetary Network Nexus,\" is a decentralized cryptocurrency that aims to address some of the limitations and challenges faced by existing digital currencies, including Zephyr. Developed by a team of experienced blockchain engineers and financial experts, MNN incorporates advanced technologies and innovative concepts to create a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly cryptocurrency ecosystem. One of MNN's key features is its unique consensus mechanism, which combines elements of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to achieve optimal security and energy efficiency. This hybrid approach aims to mitigate the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW algorithms while maintaining the robustness and decentralization offered by PoS systems. Furthermore, MNN boasts lightning-fast transaction speeds, enabling near-instantaneous transfers and settlements. This crucial aspect addresses one of the major bottlenecks faced by many existing cryptocurrencies, making MNN an attractive option for everyday transactions and widespread adoption. The MNN ecosystem also introduces innovative features designed to enhance user experience and promote wider adoption. These include a user-friendly mobile wallet, seamless integration with traditional payment systems, and a robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) built on the MNN blockchain. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While MNN's ambitious goals and innovative features hold immense promise, it faces significant challenges in dethroning the established dominance of Zephyr and other major cryptocurrencies. Building a strong user base, fostering widespread adoption, and gaining the trust of investors and regulatory bodies are crucial steps in MNN's journey to the forefront of the crypto market. However, the cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, and disruptive innovations like MNN have the potential to reshape the industry. As the world becomes increasingly digitized and decentralized, the demand for efficient, secure, and user-friendly digital currencies is likely to surge, creating opportunities for newcomers like MNN to stake their claim in the ever-expanding crypto universe. Only time will tell if MNN can live up to its ambitious goals and truly challenge the reign of Zephyr and other established cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, the emergence of innovative projects like MNN is a testament to the dynamism and creativity that fuel the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.","1408":"No content","1409":"I've been obsessed with gaming lately, and I'm all about the 'play-to-earn' trend. But let's be real, some of those blockchain games suck. I saw Saga and it's basically a project that wants to make it way easier for devs to launch their own blockchains, especially those focused on gaming and entertainment. See it like... instead of everyone trying to cram their projects onto Ethereum or Solana, Saga wants to give each project the option to have their own dedicated space while still connecting to a larger network. It's promising unlimited scalability \u2013 no more getting bogged down when a game goes viral. The idea of launching your own blockchain always sounded like rich people problems to me, but they claim to make it cheap and easy. Seems like a major draw for game studios. Also, they've gotten some serious backing and it looks like a bunch of games are already being built on this tech. Now, here's what I'm wondering: Is this how games start getting actually decentralized, not just using NFTs for cosmetics? Could this unlock the kind of crazy interconnected game worlds we keep hearing about? Or is it another overhyped infrastructure play that won't live up to the promise? I'm not a dev myself, so I'm still trying to wrap my head around the mechanics. But, as a gamer, I'm cautiously optimistic. Anyone else following Saga closely? What do you make of this whole \"launch your own blockchain\" angle?","1410":"Building a game entirely on the blockchain will make it slow and updates are limited.

In percentage terms, this is quite significant (12.5%), but in absolute terms, not so much ($20). The same can be said about the opposite situation with a drop in value. Of course, it all depends on how much SOL you have. Most likely, the large influx of liquidity and, therefore, the cost of SOL was influenced by low fee's in the chain. You can quickly manage your funds with minimal losses (staking\/restaking with more favorable conditions or APY). As they say Solana chain for degens, which I mean as a huge number of shitcoins, NFT flipps and airdrops as well.","1417":"Perhaps it's strange to me and believe it is too to others.

So I did a quick search to find out why the move on SOL but I couldn't find a cleared reason. here is the only relatively sensiable fact by coindesk.

I do hope that the team will help, but the chances are slim, next time always be sure that the exchange supports the coin that you want to deposit, first of all, Wrapped ETH is different from ETH, the majority of exchanges these days don't support WETH, always check first before proceeding.

Coinbase is one of many exchanges that really hard to recover losing funds, most of the cases they don't want to recover. Someone was send 29 ETH and Coinbase gave a same answer, if they didn't want to recover 29 WETH, they wouldn't want to recover the funds that just 1 WETH.","1446":"Have you contacted the admin of the app\/website? Some exchanges really do give back the money you sent accidentally given of course that you contact them and request for it. The waiting comes after that. It might take a while but it definitely possible. That's not possible at all, you can look for it anywhere (Reddit, Quora, etc.) and you definitely won't find it, Coinbase has its own procedures and it's different from Binance, if you send unsupported token to Binance, of course they will return it to you with a small recovery fee. I mean don't give @OP false expectations or pessimism, maybe he can learn from his mistakes. Don't make @OP pessimistic with your statement, it's not 100% gone yet, as the asset @OP is referring to is a well-known token (WETH), let's hope Coinbase ASAP in the future support $WETH. Yeah, probably Coinbase will add WETH in the next 2 years, also @OP need to hope if won't bankrupt until he can withdraw his token. LOL, let's hope that will happen soon and don't have to wait another 2 years, I'm afraid they will have a case like what KuCoin recently experienced in the future .","1447":"No content","1448":"How do you view these two projects as potential investments? I mean buying them off of an exchange and holding them long term","1449":"Starknet: 10B total supply and around 728M circulating. They had a huge unlock that was supposed to happened in March, but was pushed back after their community members raised concerns about the impact a hefty unlock like that would do to the short price movement. Among all \"major\" L2s, Starknet is one of the least used and before the dencun upgrade, it was one of the most expensive L2. My bias: Can't and won't be showing up (won't buy). At $2, the FDV of starknet is around $20B, at most, the price can only do like a 100% or probably less since the interest is split among other L2s. I can trade it short term on futures though. Not worthy of holding for me. EtherFi: For this one, my reply will be biased because I'm a holder. EtherFi is the top LRT protocol on EigenLayer and they have tons of really good backers, will only 1B total supply and only around 12% in circulation means that there's plenty of opportunities for this to grow. ETHFI reminds me of the Celestia (TIA) run 4 months ago. Bias: Premarket price was $5 and above and is trading below $3.7. I reckon that the price should soon put premarket buyers in the green and with EigenLayer launching soon and AVS projects doing some sorts of airdrop for EtherFi (the protocol or token), then it is a good buy for me especially in a full blown parabolic crypto run with restaking narrative going haywire.","1450":"I don\u2019t know much about etherfi other than the fact that it has been here quite a long time. On the other hand, starknet is a new project that has some really clear objectives from the development team implying that they know what they are doing and has clear plans on how to do them. To me, that is usually a good indication of how much this coin can develop. Having decrease transaction fees, I am quite interested. I might not recommend this one for long term holding but I can see making profits on the early run.","1451":"How do you view these two projects as potential investments? I mean buying them off of an exchange and holding them long term Potential investment goes to ether.fi (ETHFI) if we only look at market capitalization, Starknet is ranked 70 in CMC while ether.fi is ranked 178 in CMC. But if we look at it fundamentally, Starknet is more promising than ether.fi. AFAIK, ether.fi is just a restaking protocol on Ethereum (ETH), for me, there's nothing special in ether.fi because no game changer there, there are only 4 main prizes for eETH minter there including: - Ethereum staking rewards - Ether.fi Loyalty Points - Restaking rewards (including EigenLayer points) - Ability to provide liquidity to Defi protocols. Have any of you seen anything special?","1452":"Not sure why you would even buy them instead of just farming their airdrops? Farming a protocol's airdrops(the newer ones like these 2 though starket has already been released, when available) is simply a far far better r\/r bet than buying the token. (Check out paldo.io for an airdrop list.) As for the viability of these projects: Starknet is an Ethereum L2 \u2014 that category is pretty congested and I personally don't have a clue whose going to win out of the dozens and dozens of L2s Etherfi is a liquid restaking protocol \u2014 whereas there are also dozens of LRT protocols battling it out so I don't know as well who's going to win","1453":"How do you view these two projects as potential investments? Starknet IMO. this token is not even worth to buy. My cons are - Big supply but only less than 10% already unlocked. - High fees compared to another L2s - Less users compared to the other L2s Etherfi - This token used as a governance token only and nothing more - i have no reason in owning this token although it offers season 2 airdrop for the holders. I mean buying them off of an exchange and holding them long term It's very bad idea. Why don't you buy a good token that has fully unlocked in the exchange site? I meant that have been plenty of tokens are also giving you various options.","1454":"How do you view these two projects as potential investments? I mean buying them off of an exchange and holding them long term Starknet is a layer 2 of ethereum and not only that their technology is being used by many top project throughout the industry. Though their community airdrop was controversial and people don't like it also they don't have any unique usecase that separates them from other layer 2. This also can be seen in their user drop. On the other hand ethfi is a eth Liquid staking platform and they are one of the market leader in this sector. So ethfi has better chance of survival than the starknet.","1455":"No content","1456":"For months, for weeks and for days which I have been planning to invest in Ethereum but I don't know which of the wallet I would used to hodle the coins for a long term investment.

I used MetaMask a long time ago, and I did not quite like it, but since they added new features lately, I just decided to try it again, and yet I still do not like the wallet. The Android version is very slow on my Android, while my phone RAM is very large, and the app was not supposed to be misbehaving on my phone, but it was. I didn't try the Window's extension of the metamask on my system, but that was because I did not like the wallet for one major reason too. The metamask Android version doesn't allow the creation of an address unless your device internet connection is turned on; the app will not even open if your network is not connected to the internet, which to me is more like creating an online wallet. I tried the Unstoppable wallet, and I was able to create multiple wallet without an internet connection. This wallet is also open source, which is why I think it is very recommendable. While creating your wallet address, do it offline (you can put your device or flight mood), and when done creating the wallet address, manually back up your secret phrase, copy your deposit address for the desired coin, and then delete the generated address to avoid your phrase being online. Then you can use the address to impot to the wallet as a watch address.","1459":"For months, for weeks and for days which I have been planning to invest in Ethereum but I don't know which of the wallet I would used to hodle the coins for a long term investment.

Several exchanges could be your choice if you want. and I think you have looked for it instead of focusing on the exchange you mean. i just googled xyo to eth and it was one of the first links. Kucoin o Coinbase supports xyo or chsb? They need KYC to use it?","1495":"i just googled xyo to eth and it was one of the first links. Kucoin o Coinbase supports xyo or chsb? They need KYC to use it? Yes both Coinbase and Kucoin are centralized exchanges and demand for KYC since it is part of the regulatory compliance for centralized exchanges. I advise you to go along with what you already have and Simpleswap or any of the popular Dex will and should do what you want at the moment, so all the best and do extra research before you use them.","1496":"Kucoin o Coinbase supports xyo or chsb? XYO trades on both exchanges. They don't seem to support CSHB. Please note if you are planning to withdraw ETH, you are going to spend ridiculous amounts in withdrawal fees that those exchanges set. For example on Kucoin, withdrawal fee is 0.005 ETH (~ $20) They need KYC to use it? Yes they do.","1497":"thank you both. I'll think about all the info you gave me.

Here is their ANN: https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=4187686 Here is their Forum Profile: https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?action=profile;u=2056315 Before using them, I suggest you first read their Terms of service to avoid any inconveniences which may arise 1. https:\/\/simpleswap.io\/terms-of-service 2. https:\/\/simpleswap.io\/privacy-policy I have not used this simpleswap site to exchange token to coin but I have used Centralized exchanges but from what Bitcoin_Arena presented here and when I checked the links he provided they are good and look legit so I also recommend them to you op. You can use them to make the swapping but the if is difficult to use and the token is listed in binance and any other exchange platform then you can use the exchange to make the swapping. All what you have to do is to send the token from the Trezor to the exchange and do the transaction and as you asked, yes you can do that. Just send it and that is all.","1500":"No content","1501":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month? Please answer only YES and NO if possible.

Thank you. the thing is that the price of ethereum may not reach to that point you expected because we have other coins people are investing on and people are seriously buying so I want to let you know that what makes all this coins to increase in the market is when they have a massive adoption and the if the Lack adoption the price will continue to decrease in value instead of increasing in value that is why I don't like to predict the features of altcoin so from your home observation and the research it can be possible that the price of ethereum May heat to the value or to the digit you mentioned it can be possible because the crypto market is increasing day by day especially Bitcoin follow the possibility is there for any coin to be a beneficiary of this market increment","1504":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month? Please answer only YES and NO if possible. Thank you. I would also say no, it is difficult to predict such a price in a month's time for Ethereum. And if it is predicted in the next two or three months or next year, there is still a possibility that after the halving it will go through several processes to reach that price. Maybe more than that, but even that should be supported if the Ethereum ETF approves it. And the official announcement on March 4, 2024 has been postponed, and a new decision to approve or reject an Ethereum spot ETF after the first final deadline comes in May 2024. So we'll see how it develops.","1505":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month? Please answer only YES and NO if possible. Thank you. Too early to say but I think reaching that much in just a Month is like telling us that there will be a big hype for ETH this Month and for me, this will not happen because that\u2019s a huge pump. Let\u2019s be more realistic here and predict a real price trend, don\u2019t just follow the hype and feel FOMO because you might taking too much risk for this one.","1506":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month? Please answer only YES and NO if possible. Thank you. Its almost 5k which is hard to achieve before the ETF approval. ETH will eventually go to that level but i don't think its price will spike that much within this month. On the other hand if SEC approve ETH ETF before the deadline which is likely to happen, then there is a chance to get to that level as all of those ETF managers will start accumulating ETH from the market and ETH staking and eigenlayer protocol already locked up a portion of the circulating supply of ETH so a supply shock can happen in here as well.","1507":"NO ethereum will definitely reach that amount of price but i do not think it will be happening any time soon the price increasing that much for a short period of time can bear a few sequences at the end","1508":"NO ethereum will definitely reach that amount of price but i do not think it will be happening any time soon the price increasing that much for a short period of time can bear a few sequences at the end I mean, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high, so why not? Anyway, time will tell whether Ethereum will get to $4,891 or not, but I prefer to give it more time rather than just this month. Ethereum usually achieves its all-time high several days after Bitcoin has done so, and at the moment, I don't think the Bitcoin rally is done yet.","1509":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month? Please answer only YES and NO if possible. Thank you. The way the price started to rise, it looked like Ethereum would soon hit $4,000. But Bitcoin recovers from the highs and drops back down to settle at $59,000. While Bitcoin stood at $59,000, Ethereum fell to $3,200. However, I believe if the market starts to move higher again, Ethereum can certainly hold $4000 before the halving, and if the next bull market and Ethereum ETF are approved, I think it can hold up to $10000.","1510":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month? Please answer only YES and NO if possible. Thank you. Anything is possible and only time can tell. But don't compare the move of Bitcoin to Ethereum. So, if it's possible I'd say yes but we don't know if your given time will make it happen. To answer that shortly, if you have that price target then give it a longer time so that you won't expect that much. ETH etf has been delayed and I think that I see the pattern there and it will get another delay soon.","1511":"There's no accurate prediction if eth price will reach 4k+ and the timeframe you have given. It is possible that it will reach and it is also a no. If bitcoin increased more then it is possible that eth would also increase but as of now, eth alone reaching 4k+ would mean that there's a hype or something good news then yes it will reach but I don't think there's a hype for eth as of now so no and would only depends on Bitcoin price increase. I'd rather give more time rather than a month and maybe it will reach that price.","1512":"NO. It's kinda difficult and the price is too high but we must remember we are in the cryptocurrency market, everything can happen anytime, even impossible. The crypto market is full of surprises so who knows? The question of OP is very difficult.","1513":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month? Please answer only YES and NO if possible. Thank you. No!! ETH price will not be $4,800 plus this month. Yesterday the market condition was very good but the market again gave a little down. Today ETH price is $3500 plus. No one can accurately predict what will happen in the cryptocurrency market as the market can change at any time. But let's see how much the price of ETH rises this month.","1514":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month? Please answer only YES and NO if possible. Thank you. No. You are expecting too much from Ethereum for this month. It took approximately three months for Ethereum to reach the $3700 level and it will take more than a couple of months for it to reach the $4000 price point. The bull market is being driven by Bitcoin and all other coins are following it. Currently, its dominance has increased from 50% to 52% therefore it won't be that easy for Ethereum to reach the amount you are asking.","1515":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month?

Today ETH price is $3500 plus. No one can accurately predict what will happen in the cryptocurrency market as the market can change at any time. But let's see how much the price of ETH rises this month. No doubt that Ethereum, a top altcoin that is second only to Bitcoin, has the potential to reach $4000, and go beyond, but there is a very low possibility that it'll happen within this month, the bull run is just getting started and every reputable altcoins in the market will surely bull with Bitcoin. Although nobody can accurately predict what the outcome of prices of any crypto coin will be in the future, but as you said we'll still make predictions and see how the market will manoeuvre the prices.","1516":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month? Please answer only YES and NO if possible. Thank you. This year is the year that investors and bounty hunters have been waiting for, where the Bitcoin halving will occur in the next few months. The price of ethereum may not reach the $4000+ you expect, but the price of Ethereum will reach an all-time high or a new ATH will make history of Ethereum's rise at this halving. Anything can happen in the crypto world, nothing strange but to go up $4000+ is very unlikely to happen.","1517":"Give it until the end of the year and many will say that it's a yes. But if you're giving that hurry until the end of this month, it's probably not enough. The quick movement of Bitcoin doesn't mean that it will also give that quick move to Ethereum and other altcoins that are in the market. Anything can happen in the crypto world, nothing strange but to go up $4000+ is very unlikely to happen. Yes, anything can happen but if we go with the reality. It's unlikely that we see it at the end of the month but there's also the half of me telling me that we might see it.","1518":"for me more importantly is the question if ETHBTC will go back to 0.087 this cycle or even 0.1 as in 2018... but looking at the big picture the trend is more like lower highs so that's a bit concerning..","1519":"no, I'm not sure ETH will touch that price, even though the increase in eth is very good this week, but to reach 4800$ is still too high, but who knows, anything can happen out of control, and predictions","1520":"Hello, Can Ethereum reach $4,891 by the end of this month? Please answer only YES and NO if possible. Thank you. I guess, it would within March. Ethereum had been making gains and sustaining it. Bitcoin tested the resistance around it's all time high creating a new one by a small margin and correcting at the time. With the trend sustaining, we can easily see Ethereum making another all time high this month considering we have large number of days still left for the month end. Ethereum is more popular at the current moment due to its duncan update, the effect would be visible in the network making it easier for people to transact in Ethereum.","1521":"No content","1522":"ETH3.0 is a hard fork coin upgraded from Ethereum Cancun, built on the Ethereum blockchain as the Ethereum ERC-20 version.
